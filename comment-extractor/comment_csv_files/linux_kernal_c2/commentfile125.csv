  ttm_move_memcpy - Helper to perform a memcpy ttm move operation.
  @clear: Whether to clear rather than copy.
  @num_pages: Number of pages of the operation.
  @dst_iter: A struct ttm_kmap_iter representing the destination resource.
  @src_iter: A struct ttm_kmap_iter representing the source resource.
  This function is intended to be able to move out async under a
  dma-fence if desired.
 Single TTM move. NOP 
 Don't move nonexistent data. Clear destination instead. 
  ttm_buffer_object_transfer
  @bo: A pointer to a struct ttm_buffer_object.
  @new_obj: A pointer to a pointer to a newly created ttm_buffer_object,
  holding the data of @bo with the old placement.
  This is a utility function that may be called after an accelerated move
  has been scheduled. A new buffer object is created as a placeholder for
  the old data while it's being copied. When that buffer object is idle,
  it can be destroyed, releasing the space of the old placement.
  Returns:
  !0: Failure.
	
	  Fix up members that we shouldn't copy directly:
	  TODO: Explicit member copy would probably be better here.
		
		  We're mapping a single page, and the desired

	  operation has completed.
	
	  If we're not moving to fixed memory, the TTM object
	  needs to stay alive. Otherwhise hang it on the ghost

	  this eviction and free up the allocation
  ttm_bo_pipeline_gutting - purge the contents of a bo
  @bo: The buffer object
  Purge the contents of a bo, async if the bo is not idle.
  After a successful call, the bo is left unpopulated in
  system placement. The function may wait uninterruptible
  for idle on OOM.
  Return: 0 if successful, negative error code on failure.
 If already idle, no need for ghost object dance. 
 See comment below about clearing. 
	
	  We need an unpopulated ttm_tt after giving our current one,
	  if any, to the ghost object. And we can't afford to fail
	  creating one after the operation. If the bo subsequently gets
	  resurrected, make sure it's cleared (if ttm_bo_type_device)

  implement a kmap_local functionality. We could then strip a huge amount of
  code. These linear io iterators are implemented to mimic old functionality,
  and they don't use kmap_local semantics at all internally. Rather ioremap or

  If a buffer in the list is marked for CPU access, we back off and
  wait for that buffer to become free for GPU access.
  If a buffer is reserved for another validation, the validator with
  the highest validation sequence backs off and waits for that buffer
  to become unreserved. This prevents deadlocks when validating multiple
  buffers in different orders.

  ttm_bo_vm_reserve - Reserve a buffer object in a retryable vm callback
  @bo: The buffer object
  @vmf: The fault structure handed to the callback
  vm callbacks like fault() and _mkwrite() allow for the mm_sem to be dropped
  during long waits, and after the wait the callback will be restarted. This
  is to allow other threads using the same virtual memory space concurrent
  access to map(), unmap() completely unrelated buffer objects. TTM buffer
  object reservations sometimes wait for GPU and should therefore be
  considered long waits. This function reserves the buffer object interruptibly
  taking this into account. Starvation is avoided by the vm system not
  allowing too many repeated restarts.
  This function is intended to be used in customized fault() and _mkwrite()
  handlers.

		  If the fault allows retry and this is the first

  ttm_bo_vm_fault_reserved - TTM fault helper
  @vmf: The struct vm_fault given as argument to the fault callback
  @prot: The page protection to be used for this memory area.
  @num_prefault: Maximum number of prefault pages. The caller may want to
  specify this based on madvice settings and the size of the GPU object
  backed by the memory.
  This function inserts one or more page table entries pointing to the
  memory backing the buffer object, and then returns a return code
  instructing the caller to retry the page access.
  Return:
    VM_FAULT_NOPAGE on success or pending signal
    VM_FAULT_SIGBUS on unspecified error
    VM_FAULT_OOM on out-of-memory
    VM_FAULT_RETRY if retryable wait

	  Speculatively prefault a number of pages. Only error on
	  first page.
		
		  Note that the value of @prot at this point may differ from
		  the value of @vma->vm_page_prot in the caching- and
		  encryption bits. This is because the exact location of the
		  data may not be known at mmap() time and may also change
		  at arbitrary times while the data is mmap'ed.
		  See vmf_insert_mixed_prot() for a discussion.
 Never error on prefaulted PTEs 
 Allocate new dummy page to map all the VA range in this VMA to it
 Set the page to be freed using drmm release action 
 Prefault the entire VMA range right away to avoid further faults

 Enforce no COW since would have really strange behavior with it.

 This is a best effort so we ignore errors 
	
	  FIXME Return the number of page we have migrated, again we need to
	  update the migrate API to return that information so that we can
	  report it to user space.
 Unlink channel instance from SVMM. 
 Link channel instance to SVMM. 
 Invalidate SVMM address-range on GPU. 
	
	  Ignore invalidation callbacks for device private pages since
	  the invalidation is handled as part of the migration process.
 We need to fail if svm is disabled 
 Allocate tracking for SVM-enabled VMM. 
 Check that SVM isn't already enabled for the client. 
	 Allocate a new GPU VMM that can support SVM (managed by the
	  client, with replayable faults enabled).
	 
	  All future channelmemory allocations will make use of this
	  VMM instead of the standard one.
 Note, ownership of svmm transfers to mmu_notifier 
 Issue fault replay for GPU to retry accesses that faulted previously. 
 Cancel a replayable fault that could not be handled.
  Cancelling the fault will trigger recovery to reset the engine
  and kill the offending channel (ie. GPU SIGSEGV).

	 All our channels are dead now, which means all the fences they
	  own are signalled, and all callback functions have been called.
	 
	  So, after flushing the workqueue, there should be nothing left.
	 Allocate channel that has access to a (preferably async) copy
	  engine, to use for TTM buffer moves.
		 Prior to Kepler, there's only a single runlist, so all
		  engines can be accessed from any channel.
		 
		  We still want to use a separate channel though.
 Allocate channel that has access to the graphics engine. 
	 A SW class is used on pre-NV50 HW to assist with handling the
	  synchronisation of page flips, as well as to implement fences
	  on TNTTNT2 HW that lacks any kind of support in host.
	 NvMemoryToMemoryFormat requires a notifier ctxdma for some reason,
	  even if notification is never requested, so, allocate a ctxdma on
	  any GPU where it's possible we'll end up using M2MF for BO moves.
 Initialise global support for channels, and synchronisation. 
	XXX: this is crap, but the fencechannel stuff is a little
	      backwards in some places.  this will be fixed.
 Volta requires access to a doorbell register for kickoff. 
 Allocate channels we need to support various functions. 
 Initialise accelerated TTM buffer moves. 
	 workaround an odd issue on nvc1 by disabling the device's
	  nosnoop capability.  hopefully won't cause issues until a
	  better fix is found - assuming there is one...
	
	  There may be existing clients from as-yet unclosed files. For now,
	  clean them up here rather than deferring until the file is closed,

	  properly.
  On some Intel PCIe bridge controllers doing a
  D0 -> D3hot -> D3cold -> D0 sequence causes Nvidia GPUs to not reappear.
  Skipping the intermediate D3hot step seems to make it work again. This is
  probably caused by not meeting the expectation the involved AML code has
  when the GPU is put into D3hot state before invoking it.
  This leads to various manifestations of this issue:
   - AML code execution to power on the GPU hits an infinite loop (as the
     code waits on device memory to change).
   - kernel crashes, as all PCI reads return -1, which most code isn't able
     to handle well enough.
  In all cases dmesg will contain at least one line like this:
  'nouveau 0000:01:00.0: Refused to change power state, currently in D3'
  followed by a lot of nouveau timeouts.
  In the \_SB.PCI0.PEG0.PG00._OFF code deeper down writes bit 0x80 to the not
  documented PCI config space register 0x248 of the Intel PCIe bridge
  controller (0x1901) in order to change the state of the PCIe link between
  the PCIe port and the GPU. There are alternative code paths using other
  registers, which seem to work fine (executed pre Windows 8):
   - 0xbc bit 0x20 (publicly available documentation claims 'reserved')
   - 0xb0 bit 0x10 (link disable)
  Changing the conditions inside the firmware by poking into the relevant
  addresses does resolve the issue, but it seemed to be ACPI private memory
  and not any device accessible memory at all, so there is no portable way of
  changing the conditions.
  On a XPS 9560 that means bits [0,3] on \CPEX need to be cleared.
  The only systems where this behavior can be seen are hybrid graphics laptops
  with a secondary Nvidia Maxwell, Pascal or Turing GPU. It's unclear whether
  this issue only occurs in combination with listed Intel PCIe bridge
  controllers and the mentioned GPUs or other devices as well.
  documentation on the PCIe bridge controller can be found in the
  "7th Generation Intel® Processor Families for H Platforms Datasheet Volume 2"
  Section "12 PCI Express Controller (x16) Registers"
	 We need to check that the chipset is supported before booting
	  fbdev off the hardware, as there's no way to put it back.
 Remove conflicting drivers (vesafb, efifb etc).

	  The device is gone, and as it currently stands all clients are
	  cleaned up in the removal codepath. In the future this may change
	  so that we can support hot-unplugging, but for now we immediately
	  return to avoid a double-free situation.

		  uncached mapping if we can't.
 Determine the desirable target GPU page size for the buffer. 
		 Because we cannot currently allow VMM maps to fail
		  during buffer migration, we need to determine page
		  size for the buffer up-front, and pre-allocate its
		  page tables.
		 
		  Skip page sizes that can't support needed domains.
		 Select this page size if it's the first that supports
		  the potential memory domains, or when it's compatible
		  with the requested compression settings.
 Stop once the buffer is larger than the current page size. 
 Disable compression if suitable settings couldn't be found.

  FIXME: this is ugly right now we are using TTM to allocate vram and we pin
  it in vram while in use. We likely want to overhaul memory management for
  nouveau to be more page like (not necessarily with system page size but a
  bigger page size) at lowest level and have some shim layer on top that would
  provide the same functionality as TTM.
	
	  FIXME when chunk->callocated reach 0 we should add the chunk to
	  a reclaim list so that it can be freed in case of memory pressure.
		
		  FIXME wait for channel to be IDLE before calling finalizing
		  the hmem object.
	
	  FIXME what we really want is to find some heuristic to migrate more
	  than just one page on CPU fault. When such fault happens it is very
	  likely that more surrounding page will CPU fault too.
 Allocate unused physical address space for device private pages. 
 FIXME handle pin failure

			  Non-EDID modes will force the use of GPU scaling
			  to the native mode regardless of this setting.

	  if possible.
		 Override encoder type for DVI-I based on whether EDID
		  says the display is digital or analog, both use the
		  same i2c channel so the value returned from ddc_detect
		  isn't necessarily correct.
 Try retrieving EDID via DDC 
	 On some laptops (Sony, i'm looking at you) there appears to
	  be no direct way of accessing the panel's EDID.  The only
	  option available to us appears to be to ask ACPI for help..

	  the nouveau decides an entry in the VBIOS FP mode table is
	  valid - it's not (rh#613284)
	 If no EDID found above, and the VBIOS indicates a hardcoded
	  modeline is avalilable for the panel, set it as the panel's
	  native mode and exit.
	 Still nothing, some VBIOS images have a hardcoded EDID block
	  stored for the panel stored in them.
 if the edid is feeling nice enough to provide this info, use it 
 EDID 1.4 is supposed to be supported on eDP, but, Apple...

	 destroy the native mode, the attached monitor could have changed.
	 Determine display colour depth for everything except LVDS now,
	  DP requires this before mode_valid() is called.
	 Find the native mode if this is a digital panel, if we didn't
	  find any modes through DDC previously add the native mode to
	  the list of modes.
	 Determine LVDS colour depth, must happen after determining
	  "native" mode as some VBIOS tables require us to use the

	  Ensure that all accesses to fence->channel complete before freeing
	  the channel.
  In an ideal world, read would not assume the channel context is still alive.
  This function may be called from another device, running into free memory as a
  result. The drm node should still be there, so we can derive the index from
  the fence context.
	
	  caller should have a reference on the fence,
	  else fence could get freed here
	
	  This needs uevents to work correctly, but dma_fence_add_callback relies on
	  being able to enable signaling. It will still get signaled eventually,
	  just not right away.

 these defines are made up 
 also FEATURE_QUADRO for BMP 
	
	  There's a few checksums in the BIOS, so here's a generic checking
	  function.
 pre BIT 
 off-on delay in ms 
 Powerbook specific quirks 
	
	  The BIT LVDS table's header has the information to setup the
	  necessary registers. Following the standard 4 byte header are:
	  A bitmask byte and a dual-link transition pxclk value for use in
	  selecting the init script when not using straps; 4 script pointers
	  for panel power, selected by output and onoff; and 8 table pointers
	  for panel init, the needed one determined by output, and bits in the
	  conf byte. These tables are similar to the TMDS tables, consisting
	  of a list of pxclks and script pointers.
	
	  For now we assume version 3.0 table - g80 support will need some
	  changes
 using EDID 
	
	  LVDS operations are multiplexed in an effort to present a single API
	  which works with two vastly differing underlying structures.
	  This acts as the demux
 don't let script change pll->head binding 
 some scripts set a value in NV_PBUS_POWERCTRL_2 and break video overlay 
	
	  BMP version (0xa) LVDS table has a simple header of version and
	  record length. The BIT LVDS table has the typical BIT table header:
	  version byte, header length byte, record length byte, and a byte for
	  the maximum number of records that can be held in the table.
 pre NV40 
 NV4x 
 G80G90 
	
	  The fp strap is normally dictated by the "User Strap" in
	  PEXTDEV_BOOT_0[20:16], but on BMP cards when bit 2 of the
	  Internal_Flags struct at 0x48 is set, the user strap gets overriden
	  by the PCI subsystem ID during POST, but not before the previous user
	  strap has been committed to CR58 for CR57=0xf on head A, which may be
	  read and used instead
 Most laptop cards lack an fp table. They use DDC. 
	
	  BMP version 0x5.0x11 BIOSen have version 1 like tables, but no
	  version field, and miss one of the spread spectrumPWM bytes.
	  This could affect early GF2Go parts (not seen any appropriate ROMs
	  though). Here we assume that a version of 0x05 matches this case
	  (combining with a BMP version check would be better), as the
	  common case for the panel type field is 0x0005, and that is in
	  fact what we are reading the first byte of.
 some NV10, 11, 15, 16 
 some NV1516, and NV11+ 
 NV40+ 
		
		  fptable[4] is the minimum
		  RAMDAC_FP_HCRTC -> RAMDAC_FP_HSYNC_START gap
 !mobile only needs digital_min_front_porch 
 nv4x cards need both a strap value and fpindex of 0xf to use DDC 
	
	  If either the strap or xlated fpindex value are 0xf there is no
	  panel using a strap-derived bios mode present.  this condition
	  includes, but is different from, the DDC panel indicator above
 just checking whether we can produce a mode 
	
	  For version 1.0 (version in byte 0):
	  bytes 1-2 are "panel type", including bits on whether Colourmono,
	  singledual link, and type (TFT etc.)
	  bytes 3-6 are bits per colour in RGBX
 bytes 9-10 is HActive 
	
	  bytes 13-14 is HValid Start
	  bytes 15-16 is HValid End
 bytes 23-24, 27-30 similarly, but vertical 
	
	  bytes 38-39 relate to spread spectrum settings
	  bytes 40-43 are something to do with PWM
	
	  The LVDS table header is (mostly) described in
	  parse_lvds_manufacturer_table_header(): the BIT header additionally
	  contains the dual-link transition pxclk (in 10s kHz), at byte 5 - if
	  straps are not being used for the panel, this specifies the frequency
	  at which modes should be set up in the dual link style.
	 
	  Following the header, the BMP (ver 0xa) table has several records,
	  indexed by a separate xlat table, indexed in turn by the fp strap in
	  EXTDEV_BOOT. Each record had a config byte, followed by 6 script
	  numbers for use by INIT_SUB which controlled panel init and power,
	  and finally a dword of ms to sleep between power off and on
	  operations.
	 
	  In the BIT versions, the table following the header serves as an
	  integrated config and xlat table: the records in the table are
	  indexed by the FP strap nibble in EXTDEV_BOOT, and each record has
	  two bytes - the first as a config byte, the second for indexing the
	  fp mode table pointed to by the BIT 'D' table
	 
	  DDC is not used until after card init, so selecting the correct table
	  entry and setting the dual link flag for EDID equipped panels,
	  requiring tests against the native-mode pixel clock, cannot be done
	  until later, when this function should be called with non-zero pxclk
 pre NV40 
 we're done if this isn't the EDID panel case 
			 nv17 behaviour
			 
			  It seems the old style lvds script pointer is reused
			  to select 1824 bit colour depth for EDID panels.
			 nv28 behaviour (off-chip encoder)
			 
			  nv28 does a complex dance of first using byte 121 of
			  the EDID to choose the lvdsmanufacturerindex, then
			  later attempting to match the EDID manufacturer and
			  product IDs in a table (signature 'pidt' (panel id
			  table?)), setting an lvdsmanufacturerindex of 0 and
			  an fp strap of the match index (or 0xf if none)
 nv31, nv34 behaviour 
		
		  nvidia set the high nibble of (cr57=f, cr58) to
		  lvdsmanufacturerindex in this case; we don't
 NV4x 
 G80G90 
		
		  No sign of the "power off for reset" or "reset for panel
		  on" bits, but it's safer to assume we should
		
		  It's ok lvdsofs is wrong for nv4x edid case; dual_link is
		  over-written, and if_is_24bit isn't used
 set dual_link flag for EDID case 
	
	  the pxclk parameter is in kHz
	 
	  This runs the TMDS regs setting code found on BIT bios cards
	 
	  For ffs(or) == 1 use the first table, for ffs(or) == 2 and
	  ffs(or) == 3, use the second.

	  Parses the init table segment for pointers used in script execution.

	  offset + 8  (16 bits): io condition table pointer
	  offset + 10 (16 bits): io flag condition table pointer
	  offset + 12 (16 bits): init function table pointer
	
	  Parses the load detect values for g80 cards.
	 
	  offset + 0 (16 bits): loadval table pointer
 First entry is normal dac, 2nd tv-out perhaps? 
	
	  Parses the flat panel table segment that the bit entry points to.
	  Starting at bitentry->offset:
	 
	  offset + 0  (16 bits): ??? table pointer - seems to have 18 byte
	  records beginning with a freq.
	  offset + 2  (16 bits): mode table pointer
	
	  Parses the init table segment that the bit entry points to.
	 
	  See parse_script_table_pointers for layout

	  offset + 0  (32 bits): BIOS version dword (as in B table)
	  offset + 5  (8  bits): BIOS feature byte (same as for BMP?)
	  offset + 13 (16 bits): pointer to table containing DAC load
	  detection comparison values
	 
	  There's other things in the table, purpose unknown
	
	  bit 4 seems to indicate a mobile bios (doesn't suffer from BMP's
	  Quadro identity crisis), other bits possibly as for BMP feature byte
 doesn't exist on g80 
	
	  The first value in the table, following the header, is the
	  comparison value, the second entry is a comparison value for
	  TV load detection.
	
	  Parses the LVDS table segment that the bit entry points to.
	  Starting at bitentry->offset:
	 
	  offset + 0  (16 bits): LVDS strap xlate table pointer
	
	  No idea if it's still called the LVDS manufacturer table, but
	  the concept's close enough.
	
	  offset + 2  (8  bits): number of options in an
	  	INIT_RAM_RESTRICT_ZM_REG_GROUP opcode option set
	  offset + 3  (16 bits): pointer to strap xlate table for RAM
	  	restrict option selection
	 
	  There's a bunch of bits in this table other than the RAM restrict
	  stuff that we don't use - their use currently unknown
	
	  Older bios versions don't have a sufficiently long table for
	  what we want
	
	  Parses the pointer to the TMDS table
	 
	  Starting at bitentry->offset:
	 
	  offset + 0  (16 bits): TMDS table pointer
	 
	  The TMDS table is typically found just before the DCB table, with a
	  characteristic signature of 0x11,0x13 (1.1 being version, 0x13 being
	  length?)
	 
	  At offset +7 is a pointer to a script, which I don't know how to
	  run yet.
	  At offset +9 is a pointer to another script, likewise
	  Offset +11 has a pointer to a table where the first word is a pxclk
	  frequency and the second word a pointer to a script, which should be
	  run if the comparison pxclk frequency is less than the pxclk desired.
	  This repeats for decreasing comparison frequencies
	  Offset +13 has a pointer to a similar table
	  The selection of table (and possibly +7+9 script) is dictated by
	  "or" from the DCB.
 nv50+ has v2.0, but we don't parse it atm 
	
	  These two scripts are odd: they don't seem to get run even when
	  they are not stubbed.
	
	  The only restriction on parsing order currently is having 'i' first
	  for use of bios->_version or bios->feature_byte while parsing;
	  functions shouldn't be actually doing anything apart from pulling
	  data from the image into the bios struct, thus no interdependencies

		  Never observed in use with lvds scripts, but is reused for
		  1824 bit panel interface default for EDID equipped panels
		  (if_is_24bit not set directly to avoid any oscillation).
		
		  v1.4 (some NV1516, NV11+) seems the same as v1.5, but
		  always has the same single (crt) entry, even when tv-out
		  present, so the conclusion is this version cannot really

		  v1.2 tables (some NV610, and NV15+) normally have the
		  same 5 entries, which are not specific to the card and so
		  no use.
		 
		  v1.2 does have an I2C table that read_dcb_i2c_table can
		  handle, but cards exist (nv11 in #14821) with a bad i2c
		  table pointer, so use the indices parsed in
		  parse_bmp_structure.
		 
		  v1.1 (NV5+, maybe some NV4) is entirely unhelpful
 seen on an NV11 with DCB v1.5 
 seen on an NV17 with DCB v2.0 
 ie OFF CHIP 
		
		  Although the rest of a CRT conf dword is usually
		  zeros, mac biosen have stuff there so we must mask
			
			  The laptop in bug 14567 lies and claims to not use
			  straps when it does, so assume all DCB 2.0 laptops
			  use straps, until a broken EDID using one is produced
			
			  Both 0x4 and 0x8 show up in v2.0 tables; assume they
			  mean the same thing (probably wrong, but might work)
			
			  Until we even try to use these on G8x, it's
			  useless reporting unknown bits.  They all are.
 weird g80 mobile type that "nv" treats as a terminator 
		 Normal entries consist of a single bit, but dual link has
		  the next most significant bit set too
 unsure what DCB version introduces this, 3.0? 
 same as heads, hopefully safe enough 
	
	  DCB v2.0 lists each output combination separately.
	  Here we merge compatible entries to have fewer outputs, with
	  more options

	  Identical, except apparently a different connector on a
	  different SOR link.  Not a clue how we're supposed to know
	  which one is in use if it even shares an i2c line...
	 
	  Ignore the connector on the second SOR link to prevent
	  nasty problems until this is sorted (assuming it's not a
	  VBIOS bug).

	  The DVIVGA encoder combo that's supposed to represent the
	  DVI-I connector actually point at two different ones, and
	  the HDMI connector ends up paired with the VGA instead.
	 
	  Connector table is missing anything for VGA at all, pointing it
	  an invalid conntab entry 2 so we figure it out ourself.

		 Ignore the I2C index for on-chip TV-out, as there
		  are cards with bogus values (nv31m in bug 23212),
		  and it's otherwise useless.
	 heuristic: if we ever get a non-zero connector field, assume
	  that all the indices are valid and we don't need fake them.
	 
	  and, as usual, a blacklist of boards with bad bios data..
	 no useful connector info available, we need to make it up
	  ourselves.  the rule here is: anything on the same i2c bus
	  is considered to be on the same connector.  any output
	  without an associated i2c bus is assigned its own unique
	  connector index.
	 if we created more than one connector, destroy the connector
	  table - just in case it has random, rather than stub, entries.
 handle pre-DCB boards 
	
	  apart for v2.1+ not being known for requiring merging, this
	  guarantees dcbent->index is the index of the entry in the rom image
 dump connector table entries to log, if any exist 
	
	  The header following the "HWSQ" signature has the number of entries,
	  and the entry size
	 
	  An entry consists of a dword to write to the sequencer control reg
	  (0x00001304), followed by the ucode bytes, written sequentially,
	  starting at reg 0x00001400

	  BMP based cards, from NV17, need a microcode loading to correctly

	  BIT based cards seem to do this directly in the init scripts
	 
	  The microcode entries are found by the "HWSQ" signature.

	 Clear the entire fbcon.  The drm will program every connector

	  quite likely have garbage around the console.

 To allow resizeing without swapping buffers 
	 Since runtime resume can happen as a result of a sysfs operation,
	  it's possible we already have the console locked. So handle fbcon
	  initdeinit from a seperate work thread
		 If the GPU was already in the process of suspending before
		  this event happened, then we can't block here as we'll
		  deadlock the runtime pmops since they wait for us to
		  finish. So, just defer this event for when we runtime
		  resume again. It will be handled by fbcon_work.

	 in some cases the puller may be left in an inconsistent state
	  if you try to stop it while it's busy translating handles.
	  sometimes you get a CACHE_ERROR, sometimes it just fails
	  silently; sending incorrect instance offsets to PGRAPH after
	  it's started up again.
	 
	  to avoid this, we invalidate the most recently calculated
	  instance.

	 HW bug workaround:
	 
	  PFIFO will hang forever if the connected engines don't report
	  that they've processed the context switch request.
	 
	  In order for the kickoff to work, we need to ensure all the
	  connected engines are in a state where they can answer.
	 
	  Newer chipsets don't seem to suffer from this issue, and well,
	  there's also a "ignore these engines" bitmask reg we can use
	  if we hit the issue there..
 do the kickoff... 
 remove channel from runlist, fifo will unload context

	 allocate memory for a "mmio list" buffer that's used by the HUB
	  fuc to modify some per-context register settings on first load
	  of the context.
 allocate buffers referenced by mmio list 
 finally, fill in the mmio list and point the context at it 
  PGRAPH register lists

	XXX: We need to allocate + map the above into PMU's inst block,
	      which which means we probably need a proper PMU before we
	      even bother.
  Wait until GR goes idle. GR is considered idle if it is disabled by the
  MC (0x200) register, or GR is not busy and a context switch is not in
  progress.
		
		  required to make sure FIFO_ENGINE_STATUS (0x2640) is
		  up-to-date
			
			  Wait for GR to go idle after submitting a
			  GO_IDLE bundle
		
		  notifier interrupt, only needed for cyclestats
		  can be safely ignored
 Initialize context from an external (secure or not) firmware 
 load fuc microcode 
 securely-managed falcons must be reset using secure boot 
 start both of them running 
 Determine how much memory is required to store main context image. 
 Determine how much memory is required to store ZCULL image. 
 Determine how much memory is required to store PerfMon image. 
	XXX: We (likely) require PMU support to even bother with this.
	 
	      Also, it seems like not all GPUs support ELPG.  Traces I
	      have here show RM enabling it on KeplerTuring, but none
	      of the GPUs between those.  NVGPU decides this by PCIID.
 Generate golden context image.

 load register lists 
 start HUB ucode running, it'll init the GPCs 
 Sort GPCs by TPC count, highest-to-lowest. 
 Determine tile->GPC mapping 
	 On certain GP107GP108 boards, we trigger a weird issue where
	  GR will stop responding to PRI accesses after we've asked the
	  SEC2 RTOS to boot the GR falcons.  This happens with far more
	  frequency when cold-booting a board (ie. returning from D3).
	 
	  The root cause for this is not known and has proven difficult
	  to isolate, with many avenues being dead-ends.
	 
	  A workaround was discovered by Karol, whereby putting GR into
	  reset for an extended period right before initialisation
	  prevents the problem from occuring.
	 
	  XXX: As RM does not require any such workaround, this is more
	       of a hack than a true fix.

  Graphics object classes
  Software methods, why they are needed, and how they all work:
  NV04 and NV05 keep most of the state in PGRAPH context itself, but some
  2d engine settings are kept inside the grobjs themselves. The grobjs are
  3 words long on both. grobj format on NV04 is:
  word 0:
   - bits 0-7: class
   - bit 12: color key active
   - bit 13: clip rect active
   - bit 14: if set, destination surface is swizzled and taken from buffer 5
             [set by NV04_SWIZZLED_SURFACE], otherwise it's linear and taken
             from buffer 0 [set by NV04_CONTEXT_SURFACES_2D or
             NV03_CONTEXT_SURFACE_DST].
   - bits 15-17: 2d operation [aka patch config]
   - bit 24: patch valid [enables rendering using this object]
   - bit 25: surf3d valid [for tex_tri and multitex_tri only]
  word 1:
   - bits 0-1: mono format
   - bits 8-13: color format
   - bits 16-31: DMA_NOTIFY instance
  word 2:
   - bits 0-15: DMA_A instance
   - bits 16-31: DMA_B instance
  On NV05 it's:
  word 0:
   - bits 0-7: class
   - bit 12: color key active
   - bit 13: clip rect active
   - bit 14: if set, destination surface is swizzled and taken from buffer 5
             [set by NV04_SWIZZLED_SURFACE], otherwise it's linear and taken
             from buffer 0 [set by NV04_CONTEXT_SURFACES_2D or
             NV03_CONTEXT_SURFACE_DST].
   - bits 15-17: 2d operation [aka patch config]
   - bits 20-22: dither mode
   - bit 24: patch valid [enables rendering using this object]
   - bit 25: surface_dstsurface_colorsurf2dsurf3d valid
   - bit 26: surface_srcsurface_zeta valid
   - bit 27: pattern valid
   - bit 28: rop valid
   - bit 29: beta1 valid
   - bit 30: beta4 valid
  word 1:
   - bits 0-1: mono format
   - bits 8-13: color format
   - bits 16-31: DMA_NOTIFY instance
  word 2:
   - bits 0-15: DMA_A instance
   - bits 16-31: DMA_B instance
  NV05 will setunset the relevant valid bits when you poke the relevant
  object-binding methods with object of the proper type, or with the NULL
  type. It'll only allow rendering using the grobj if all needed objects
  are bound. The needed set of objects depends on selected operation: for
  example rop object is needed by ROP_AND, but not by SRCCOPY_AND.
  NV04 doesn't have these methods implemented at all, and doesn't have the
  relevant bits in grobj. Instead, it'll allow rendering whenever bit 24
  is set. So we have to emulate them in software, internally keeping the
  same bits as NV05 does. Since grobjs are aligned to 16 bytes on nv04,
  but the last word isn't actually used for anything, we abuse it for this
  purpose.
  Actually, NV05 can optionally check bit 24 too, but we disable this since
  there's no use for it.
  For unknown reasons, NV04 implements surf3d binding in hardware as an
  exception. Also for unknown reasons, NV04 doesn't implement the clipping
  methods on the surf3d object, so we have to emulate them too.
 check for valid surf2dsurf_dstsurf_color 
 check for valid surf_srcsurf_zeta

  This code deals with PGRAPH contexts on NV50 family cards. Like NV40, it's
  the GPU itself that does context-switching, but it needs a special
  microcode to do it. And it's the driver's task to supply this microcode,
  further known as ctxprog, as well as the initial context values, known
  as ctxvals.
  Without ctxprog, you cannot switch contexts. Not even in software, since
  the majority of context [xfer strands] isn't accessible directly. You're
  stuck with a single channel, and you also suffer all the problems resulting
  from missing ctxvals, since you cannot load them.
  Without ctxvals, you're stuck with PGRAPH's default context. It's enough to
  run 2d operations, but trying to utilise 3d or CUDA will just lock you up,
  since you don't have... some sort of needed setup.
  Nouveau will just disable acceleration if not given ctxprog + ctxvals, since
  it's too much hassle to handle no-ctxprog as a special case.
  How ctxprogs work.
  The ctxprog is written in its own kind of microcode, with very small and
  crappy set of available commands. You upload it to a small [512 insns]
  area of memory on PGRAPH, and it'll be run when PFIFO wants PGRAPH to
  switch channel. or when the driver explicitely requests it. Stuff visible
  to ctxprog consists of: PGRAPH MMIO registers, PGRAPH context strands,
  the per-channel context save area in VRAM [known as ctxvals or grctx],
  4 flags registers, a scratch register, two grctx pointers, plus many
  random poorly-understood details.
  When ctxprog runs, it's supposed to check what operations are asked of it,
  save old context if requested, optionally reset PGRAPH and switch to the
  new channel, and load the new context. Context consists of three major
  parts: subset of MMIO registers and two "xfer areas".
 TODO:
   - document unimplemented bits compared to nvidia
   - NVAx: make a TP subroutine, use it.
   - use 0x4008fc instead of 0x1540?

  Constructs MMIO part of ctxprog and ctxvals. Just a matter of knowing which
  registers to saverestore and the default values for them.

  xfer areas. These are a pain.
  There are 2 xfer areas: the first one is big and contains all sorts of
  stuff, the second is small and contains some per-TP context.
  Each area is split into 8 "strands". The areas, when saved to grctx,
  are made of 8-word blocks. Each block contains a single word from
  each strand. The strands are independent of each other, their
  addresses are unrelated to each other, and data in them is closely
  packed together. The strand layout varies a bit between cards: here
  and there, a single word is thrown out in the middle and the whole
  strand is offset by a bit from corresponding one on another chipset.
  For this reason, addresses of stuff in strands are almost useless.
  Knowing sequence of stuff and size of gaps between them is much more
  useful, and that's how we build the strands in our generator.
  NVA0 takes this mess to a whole new level by cutting the old strands
  into a few dozen pieces [known as genes], rearranging them randomly,
  and putting them back together to make new strands. Hopefully these
  genes correspond more or less directly to the same PGRAPH subunits
  as in 400040 register.
  The most common value in default context is 0, and when the genes
  are separated by 0's, gene bounduaries are quite speculative...
  some of them can be clearly deduced, others can be guessed, and yet
  others won't be resolved without figuring out the real meaning of
  given ctxval. For the same reason, ending point of each strand
  is unknown. Except for strand 0, which is the longest strand and
  its end corresponds to end of the whole xfer.
  An unsolved mystery is the seek instruction: it takes an argument
  in bits 8-18, and that argument is clearly the place in strands to
  seek to... but the offsets don't seem to correspond to offsets as
  seen in grctx. Perhaps there's another, real, not randomly-changing
  addressing in strands, and the xfer insn just happens to skip over
  the unused bits? NV10-NV30 PIPE comes to mind...
  As far as I know, there's no way to access the xfer areas directly
  without the help of ctxprog.

  Authors: Ben Skeggs
 NVIDIA context programs handle a number of other conditions which are
  not implemented in our versions.  It's not clear why NVIDIA context
  programs have this code, nor whether it's strictly necessary for
  correct operation.  We'll implement additional handling ifwhen we
  discover it's necessary.
  - On context save, NVIDIA set 0x400314 bit 0 to 1 if the "3D state"
    flag is set, this gets saved into the context.
  - On context save, the context program for all cards load nsource
    into a flag register and check for ILLEGAL_MTHD.  If it's set,
    opcode 0x60000d is called before resuming normal operation.
  - Some context programs check more conditions than the above.  NV44
    checks: ((nsource & 0x0857) || (0x400718 & 0x0100) || (intr & 0x0001))
    and calls 0x60000d before resuming normal operation.
  - At the very beginning of NVIDIA's context programs, flag 9 is checked
    and if true 0x800001 is called with count=0, pos=0, the flag is cleared
    and then the ctxprog is aborted.  It looks like a complicated NOP,
    its purpose is unknown.
  - In the section of code that loads the per-vs state, NVIDIA check
    flag 10.  If it's set, they only transfer the small 0x300 byte block
    of state + the state for a single vs as opposed to the state for
    all vs units.  It doesn't seem likely that it'll occur in normal
    operation, especially seeing as it appears NVIDIA may have screwed
    up the ctxprogs for some cards and have an invalid instruction
    rather than a cp_lsr(ctx, dwords_for_1_vs_unit) instruction.
  - There's a number of places where context offset 0 (where we place
    the PRAMIN offset of the context) is loaded into either 0x408000,
    0x408004 or 0x408008.  Not sure what's up there either.
  - The ctxprogs for some cards save 0x400a00 again during the cleanup
    path for auto-loadctx.

XXX: There's a different algorithm here I've not yet figured out. 
	XXX: Not sure what this is about.  The algorithm from NVGPU
	      seems to work for all boards I tried from earlier (and

	      Let's just hardcode them for now.

 not sure what these are, route them because NVIDIA does, and
 the IRQ handler will signal the host if we ever get one.. we
 may find out ifwhy we need to handle these if so..

 calculate size of mmio context data
 set mmctx base addresses now so we don't have to do it later,
 they don't (currently) ever change
 wtf??
 strands, base offset needs to be aligned to 256 bytes
 initialise each GPC in sequence by passing in the offset of its
 context data in GPCn_CC_SCRATCH[1], and starting its FUC (which
 has previously been uploaded by the host) running.
 the GPC fuc init sequence will set GPCn_CC_SCRATCH[0] bit 31

 wait for it to complete, and adjust context size
 next!
 save context size, and tell host we're ready
 Main program loop, very simple, sleeps until woken up by the interrupt
 handler, pulls a command from the queue and executes its handler
 sleep until we have something to do
 context switch, requested by GPU?
 ack the context switch request
 request to set current channel? (not a context switch)
 request to store current channel context?
 interrupt handler
 incoming fifo command?
 queue incoming fifo command for later processing
 context switch request?
 enqueue a context switch for later processing
 firmware method?
 none we handle; report to host and ack
 anything we didn't handle, bring it to the host's attention
 FIFO | CHSW | FWMTHD
 ack, and wake up main()
 Not real sure, but, MEM_CMD 7 will hang forever if this isn't done
 Without clearing again at end of xfer, some things cause PGRAPH
 to hang with STATUS=0x00000007 until it's cleared.. fbcon can
 still function with it set however...
 Again, not real sure
 In: $r15 value to set 0x404170 to
 Waits for a ctx_4170s() call to complete
 Disables various things, waits a bit, and re-enables them..
 Not sure how exactly this helps, perhaps "ENABLE" is not such a
 good description for the bits we turn off?  Anyways, without this,
 funny things happen.
 Not a clue what this is for, except that unless the value is 0x10, the
 strand context is saved (and presumably restored) incorrectly..

 Execute per-context state overrides list
 Only executed on the first load of a channel.  Might want to look into
 removing this and having the host directly modify the channel's context
 to change this state...  The nouveau DRM already builds this list as
 it's definitely needed for NVIDIA's, so we may as well use it for now
 Input: $r1 mmio list length
 set transfer base to be the mmio list
 fetch next 256 bytes of mmio list if necessary
 256 bytes

 how many TPCs do we have?
 determine which GPC we are, setup (optional) mmio access offset
 figure out which, and how many, UNKs are actually present
 initialise context base, and size tracking
 track GPC context size here
 set mmctx base addresses now so we don't have to do it later,
 they don't currently ever change
 calculate GPC mmio context size
 calculate per-TPC mmio context size
 calculate per-UNK mmio context size
 round up basesize to 256 byte boundary (for strand SWBASE)
 wtf for?!
 calculate size of strand context data
 calculate size of tpc strand context data
 save context size, and tell HUB we're done
 Main program loop, very simple, sleeps until woken up by the interrupt
 handler, pulls a command from the queue and executes its handler
 0x0000-0x0003 are all context transfers
 fetch $flags and mask off $p1$p2
 set $p1$p2 according to transfer type
 transfer context data

 queue incoming fifo command for later processing
 ack, and wake up main()
 Set this GPC's bit in HUB_BAR, used to signal completion of various
 activities to the HUB fuc
 0x409418 - HUB_BAR_SET
 Disables various things, waits a bit, and re-enables them..
 Not sure how exactly this helps, perhaps "ENABLE" is not such a
 good description for the bits we turn off?  Anyways, without this,
 funny things happen.
 Transfer GPC context data between GPU and storage area
 In: $r15 context base address
     $p1 clear on save, set on load
     $p2 set if opposite direction donewill be done, so:

 CR44 selects head 
 CR44 takes values 0 (head A), 3 (head B) and 4 (heads tied)
  it affects only the 8 bit vga io regs, which we access using mmio at
  0xc{0,2}3c, 0x60{1,3}3, and 0x68{1,3}3d
  in general, the set value of cr44 does not matter: reg access works as
  expected and values can be set for the appropriate head by using a 0x2000
  offset as required
  however:
  a) pre nv40, the head B range of PRMVIO regs at 0xc23c was not exposed and
     cr44 must be set to 0 or 3 for accessing values on the correct head
     through the common 0xc03c addresses
  b) in tied mode (4) head B is programmed to the values set on head A, and
     access using the head B addresses can have strange results, ergo we leave
     tied mode in init once we know to what cr44 should be restored on exit
  the owner parameter is slightly abused:
  0 and 1 are treated as head values and so the set value is (owner  3)
  other values are treated as literal values to set

 not a bug 
 Failing that, a completely unused OR is the next best thing. 
	 Last resort is to assign an OR that's already active on HW,
	  but will be released during the next modeset.
 Lookup a compatible, and unused, OR to assign to the device. 
 Deal with panels requiring identity-mapped SOR assignment. 
	 First preference is to reuse the OR that is currently armed
	  on HW, if any, in order to prevent unnecessary switching.
			XXX: For various complicated reasons, we can't outright switch
			      the boot-time OR on the first modeset without some fairly
			      invasive changes.
			 
			      The systems that were fixed by modifying the OR selection
			      code to account for HDA support shouldn't regress here as
			      the HDA-enabled ORs match the relevant output's pad macro
			      index, and the firmware seems to select an OR this way.
			 
			      This warning is to make it obvious if that proves wrong.
	 If we don't need HDA, first try to acquire an OR that doesn't
	  support it to leave free the ones that do.
 Use a HDA-supporting SOR anyway. 
 We want HDA, try to acquire an OR that supports it. 
	 There weren't any free ORs that support HDA, grab one that
	  doesn't and at least allow display to work still.
 Find any OR from the class that is able to support this device. 
 Determine the specific OR, if any, this device is attached to. 
 Prior to DCB 4.1, this is hardwired like so. 
 Determine if the OR is already configured for this device. 
		 The EFI GOP driver on Ampere can leave unused DP links routed,
		  which we don't expect.  The DisableLT IED script should get
		  us back to where we need to be.
 Cull output paths we can't map to an output resource.

	 Set 'normal' (ie. when it's attached to a head) state for
	  each output resource to 'fully enabled'.
 Create output path objects for each VBIOS display path. 
 No support for chipsets prior to NV50. 
 No support for WFD yet. 
 Create connector objects based on available output paths. 
 VBIOS data should give us the most useful information. 
 No bios connector data... 
			 Heuristic: anything with the same ccb index is
			  considered to be on the same connector, any
			  output path without an associated ccb entry will
			  be put on its own connector.
 Connector shared with another output path. 
 Check that we haven't already created this connector. 
 Apparently we need to create a new one! 
	 Enforce identity-mapped SOR assignment for panels, which have
	  certain bits (ie. backlight controls) wired to a specific SOR.

 IED scripts are no longer used by UEFIRM from Ampere, but have been updated for
  the x86 option ROM.  However, the relevant VBIOS table versions weren't modified,
  so we're unable to detect this in a nice way.
 yes. 
 Intersect misc. capabilities of the OR and sink. 
 Execute BeforeLinkTraining script from DP Info table. 
 Set desired link configuration on the source. 
 Set desired link configuration on the sink. 
 Attempt to train the link in this configuration. 
 Execute AfterLinkTraining script from DP Info table. 
 Execute EnableSpreadDisableSpread script from DP Info table. 
 Execute BeforeLinkTraining script from DP Info table. 
	 Find the lowest configuration of the OR that can support
	  the required link rate.
	 
	  We will refuse to program the OR to lower rates, even if
	  link training fails at higher rates (or even if the sink
	  can't support the rate at all, though the DD is supposed
	  to prevent such situations from happening).
	 
	  Attempting to do so can cause the entire display to hang,
	  and it's better to have a failed modeset than that.
			 Try to respect sink limits too when selecting
			  lowest link configuration.
 Ensure sink is not in a low-power state. 
 Link training. 
 Skip configurations not supported by both OR and sink. 
 Program selected link configuration. 
 Execute DisableLT script from DP Info Table. 
 Prevent link from being retrained if sink sends an IRQ. 
 Check that link configuration meets current requirements. 
 Check that link is still trained. 
	 eDP panels need powering on by us (if the VBIOS doesn't default it
	  to on) before doing any AUX channel transactions.  LVDS panel power
	  is handled by the SOR itself, and not required for LVDS DDC.
		 We delay here unconditionally, even if already powered,
		  because some laptop panels having a significant resume
		  delay before the panel begins responding.
		 
		  This is likely a bit of a hack, but no better idea for
		  handling this at the moment.
		 If the eDP panel can't be detected, we need to restore
		  the panel power GPIO to avoid breaking another output.

 Calculates the hw swizzle mask and adjusts the surface's xcnt to match
 zero out a chunk of the stack to store the swizzle into
 extract cpp, src_ncomp and dst_ncomp from FORMAT
 convert FORMAT swizzle mask to hw swizzle mask
 SRC_XCNT = (xcnt  src_cpp), or 0 if no src ref in swz (hw will hang)
 Setup to handle a tiled surface
 Calculates a number of parameters the hardware requires in order
 to correctly handle tiling.
 Offset calculation is performed as follows (TpThTd from TILE_MODE):
    nTx = round_up(w  cpp, 1 << Tp) >> Tp
    nTy = round_up(h, 1 << Th) >> Th
    Txo = (x  cpp) & ((1 << Tp) - 1)
     Tx = (x  cpp) >> Tp
    Tyo = y & ((1 << Th) - 1)
     Ty = y >> Th
    Tzo = z & ((1 << Td) - 1)
     Tz = z >> Td
    off  = (Tzo << Tp << Th) + (Tyo << Tp) + Txo
    off += ((Tz  nTy  nTx)) + (Ty  nTx) + Tx) << Td << Th << Tp;
 Inputs:
    $r4: hw command (0x104800)
    $r5: ctx offset adjustment for srcdst selection
    $p2: set if dst surface
 translate TILE_MODE into Tp, Th, Td shift values
 Op = (x  cpp) & ((1 << Tp) - 1)
 Tx = (x  cpp) >> Tp
 Tyo = y & ((1 << Th) - 1)
 Ty  = y >> Th
 YTILE = ((1 << Th) << 12) | ((1 << Th) - Tyo)
 Op += Tyo << Tp
 nTx = ((w  cpp) + ((1 << Tp) - 1) >> Tp)
 nTy = (h + ((1 << Th) - 1)) >> Th
 Tys = Tp + Th
 CFG_YZ_TILE_SIZE = ((1 << Th) >> 2) << Td
 Tzo = z & ((1 << Td) - 1)
 Tz  = z >> Td
 Op += Tzo << Tys
 Ts  = Tys + Td
 Ot = ((Tz  nTy  nTx) + (Ty  nTx) + Tx) << Ts
 PITCH = (nTx - 1) << Ts
 SRC_ADDRESS_LOW   = (Ot + Op) & 0xffffffff
 CFG_ADDRESS_HIGH |= ((Ot + Op) >> 32) << 16
 Setup to handle a linear surface
 Nothing to see here.. Sets ADDRESS and PITCH, pretty non-exciting
 wait for regs to be available for use
 if QUERY_SHORT not set, write out { -, 0, TIME_LO, TIME_HI }

		 If comptags exist for the memory, but a different amount
		  than requested, the buffer is being mapped with settings
		  that are incompatible with existing mappings.
		 Failure to allocate HW comptags is not an error, the
		  caller should fall back to an uncompressed map.
		 
		  As memory can be mapped in multiple places, we still
		  need to track the allocation failure and ensure that
		  any additional mappings remain uncompressed.
		 
		  This is handled by returning an empty nvkm_tags.

 TODO: Figure out tag memory details and drop the over-cautious allocation.
 No VRAM, no tags for now. 
 tags for 14 of VRAM should be enough (81924 per GiB of VRAM) 
 we have 1617 bits in PTE 
 round up to 64 
 4 part 4 sub: 0x2000 bytes for 56 tags 
 3 part 4 sub: 0x6000 bytes for 168 tags 
	
	  About 147 bytes per tag. Let's be safe and allocate x2, which makes
	  0x4980 bytes for 64 tags, and round up to 0x6000 bytes for 64 tags.
	 
	  For 4 GiB of memory we'll have 8192 tags which makes 3 MiB, < 0.1 %.

 Recurse up the tree, unreferencingdestroying unneeded PDs. 
 PD has other valid PDEs, so we need a proper update. 
 PDE no longer required. 
				 Special handling for Tesla-class GPUs,
				  where there's no central PD, but each
				  instance has its own embedded PD.
			 PDE was pointing at dual-PTs and we're removing
			  one of them, leaving the other in place.
 GPU may have cached the PTs, flush before freeing. 
 PD has no valid PDEs left, so we can just destroy it. 
 Destroy PDPT. 
	 Determine how many SPTEs are being touched under each LPTE,
	  and drop reference counts.
 We're done here if there's no corresponding LPT. 
 Skip over any LPTEs that still have valid SPTEs. 
		 As there's no more non-UNMAPPED SPTEs left in the range
		  covered by a number of LPTEs, the LPTEs once again take
		  control over their address range.
		 
		  Determine how many LPTEs need to transition state.
			 If the MMU supports it, restore the LPTE to the
			  INVALID state to tell the MMU there is no point
			  trying to fetch the corresponding SPTEs.
 Need to clear PTE valid bits before we dma_unmap_page(). 
 GPU may have cached the PT, flush before unmap. 
 Drop PTE references. 
 Dual-PTs need special handling, unless PDE becoming invalid. 
 PT no longer neeed?  Destroy it. 
 PTE writes for unmap() not necessary. 
	 Determine how many SPTEs are being touched under each LPTE,
	  and increase reference counts.
 We're done here if there's no corresponding LPT. 
 Skip over any LPTEs that already have valid SPTEs. 
		 As there are now non-UNMAPPED SPTEs in the range covered
		  by a number of LPTEs, we need to transfer control of the
		  address range to the SPTEs.
		 
		  Determine how many LPTEs need to transition state.
			 The entire LPTE is marked as sparse, we need
			  to make sure that the SPTEs are too.
 Sparse LPTEs prevent SPTEs from being accessed. 
			 MMU supports blocking SPTEs by marking an LPTE
			  as INVALID.  We need to reverse that here.
 Take PTE references. 
 Dual-PTs need special handling. 
		 SPT already exists covering the same range as this LPT,
		  which means we need to be careful that any LPTEs which
		  overlap valid SPTEs are unmapped as opposed to invalid
		  or sparse, which would prevent the MMU from looking at
		  the SPTEs on some GPUs.
 Deconstruct address into PTE indices for each mapping level. 
 Depth-first traversal of page tables. 
 Walk down the tree, finding page tables for each level. 
 Software PT. 
			 Hardware PT.
			 
			  This is a separate step from above due to GF100 and
			  newer having dual page tables at some levels, which
			  are refcounted independently.
 Handle PTE updates. 
 Walk back up the tree to the next position. 
	 Reconstruct the failure address so the caller is able to
	  reverse any partially completed operations.
 Limit maximum page size based on remaining size. 
 Find largest page size suitable for alignment. 
 Determine number of PTEs at this page size. 
 Limited to alignment boundary of next page size. 
 Perform operation. 
	 Locate the smallest page size supported by the backend, it will
	  have the the deepest nesting of page tables.
	 Locate the structure that describes the layout of the top-level
	  page table, and determine the number of valid bits in a virtual
	  address.
 Allocate top-level page table. 
	 ... and the GPU storage for it, except on Tesla-class GPUs that
	  have the PD embedded in the instance structure.
 Initialise address-space MM. 
		 Address-space will be managed by the client for the most
		  part, except for a specified area where NVKM allocations
		  are allowed to be placed.
 Client-managed area before the NVKM-managed area. 
 NVKM-managed area. 
 Client-managed area after the NVKM-managed area. 
		 Address-space fully managed by NVKM, requiring calls to
		  nvkm_vmm_get()nvkm_vmm_put() to allocate address-space.
TODO:
  - Avoid PT readback (for dma_unmap etc), this might end up being dealt
    with inside HMM, which would be a lot nicer for us to deal with.
  - Support for systems without a 4KiB page size.
	 Only support mapping where the page size of the incoming page
	  array matches a page size available for direct mapping.
		 Narrow the operation window to cover a single action (page
		  should be mapped or not) within a single VMA.
		 Reject any operation to unmanaged regions, and areas that
		  have nvkm_memory objects mapped in them already.
		 In order to both properly refcount GPU page tables, and
		  prevent "normal" mappings and these direct mappings from
		  interfering with each other, we need to track contiguous
		  ranges that have been mapped with this interface.
		 
		  Here we attempt to either split an existing VMA so we're
		  able to flag the region as either unmappedmapped, or to
		  merge with adjacent VMAs that are already compatible.
		 
		  If the region is already compatible, nothing is required.
 Update HW page tables. 
 Iterate to next operation. 
			 Failure is signalled by clearing the valid bit on
			  any PFN that couldn't be modified as requested.
 Make sure we won't overrun the end of the memory object. 
 Check remaining arguments for validity. 
 Find the largest page size we can perform the mapping at. 
 Page size of the VMA is already pre-determined. 
 Deal with the 'offset' argument, and fetch the backend function. 
 Perform the map. 
 Merge regions that are in the same state. 
				 Region(s) are mapped, merge the unmap
				  and dereference into a single walk of
				  the page tree.
 Drop allocation-time PTE references. 
	 Merge any mapped regions that were split from the initial
	  address-space allocation back into the allocated VMA, and
	  release memorycompression resources.
		 Sparse region that was allocated with a fixed page size,
		  meaning all relevant PTEs were referenced once when the
		  region was allocated, and remained that way, regardless
		  of whether memory was mapped into it afterwards.
		 
		  The process of unmapping, unsparsing, and dereferencing
		  PTEs can be done in a single page tree walk.
		 Sparse region that wasn't allocated with a fixed page size,
		  PTE references were taken both at allocation time (to make
		  the GPU see the region as sparse), and when mapping memory
		  into the region.
		 
		  The latter was handled above, and the remaining references
		  are dealt with here.
 Remove VMA from the list of allocated nodes. 
 Merge VMA back into the free list. 
 Zero-sized, or lazily-allocated sparse VMAs, make no sense. 
	 Tesla-class GPUs can only select page size per-PDE, which means
	  we're required to know the mapping granularity up-front to find
	  a suitable region of address-space.
	 
	  The same goes if we're requesting up-front allocation of PTES.
	 If a specific page size was requested, determine its index and
	  make sure the requested size is a multiple of the page size.
 Locate smallest block that can possibly satisfy the allocation. 
	 Take into account alignment restrictions, trying larger blocks
	  in turn until we find a suitable free block.
	 If the VMA we found isn't already exactly the requested size,
	  it needs to be split, and the remaining free blocks returned.
 Pre-allocate page tables andor setup sparse mappings.

	 run a bunch of tables from rammap table.  there's actually
	  individual pointers for each rammap entry too, but, nvidia
	  seem to just run the last two entries' scripts early on in
	  their init, and never again.. we'll just run 'em all once
	  for now.
	 
	  i strongly suspect that each script is for a separate mode
	  (likely selected by 0x10f65c's lower bits?), and the
	  binary driver skips the one that's already been setup by
	  the init tables.

	 parse bios data for all rammap table entries up-front, and
	  build information on whether certain fields differ between
	  any of the entries.
	 
	  the binary driver appears to completely ignore some fields
	  when all entries contain the same value.  at first, it was
	  hoped that these were mere optimisations and the bios init
	  tables had configured as per the values here, but there is
	  evidence now to suggest that this isn't the case and we do
	  need to treat this condition as a "don't touch" indicator.

	 run a bunch of tables from rammap table.  there's actually
	  individual pointers for each rammap entry too, but, nvidia
	  seem to just run the last two entries' scripts early on in
	  their init, and never again.. we'll just run 'em all once
	  for now.
	 
	  i strongly suspect that each script is for a separate mode
	  (likely selected by 0x9a065c's lower bits?), and the
	  binary driver skips the one that's already been setup by
	  the init tables.

 binary driver only executes this path if the condition (a) is true
  for any configuration (combination of rammap+ramcfg+timing) that
  can be reached on a given card.  for now, we will execute the branch
  unconditionally in the hope that a "false everywhere" in the bios
  tables doesn't actually mean "don't touch this".
 XXX 
	 this seems wrong, alternate field used for the broadcast
	  on nuts vs non-nuts configs..  meh, it matches for now.
 binary driver does this.. bug?

	 Some GPUs are in what's known as a "mixed memory" configuration.
	 
	  This is either where some FBPs have more memory than the others,
	  or where LTCs have been disabled on a FBP.
 The common memory amount is addressed normally. 
		 And the rest is much higher in the physical address
		  space, and may not be usable for certain operations.
 GPUs without mixed-memory are a lot nicer...

 Mappings that can be evicted when BAR2 space has been exhausted. 
  instmem object implementation
	 Attempt to allocate BAR2 address-space and map the object
	  into it.  The lock has to be dropped while doing this due
	  to the possibility of recursion for page table allocation.
		 Evict unused mappings, and keep retrying until we either
		  succeed,or there's no more objects left on the LRU.
 We either failed, or another thread beat us. 
 Make the mapping visible to the host. 
		 Add the now-unused mapping to the LRU instead of directly
		  unmapping it here, in case we need to map it again later.
 Switch back to NULL accessors when last map is gone. 
 Already mapped? 
	 Take the lock, and re-check that another thread hasn't
	  already mapped the object in the meantime.
 Attempt to get a direct CPU mapping of the object. 
 Exclude object from eviction while it's being accessed. 
	 Exclude bootstrapped objects (ie. the page tables for the
	  instmem BAR itself) from eviction.
 Exclude from eviction. 
 Can be NULL during BAR destructor.

  GK20A does not have dedicated video memory, and to accurately represent this
  fact Nouveau will not create a RAM device for it. Therefore its instmem
  implementation must be done directly on top of system memory, while
  preserving coherency for read and write operations.
  Instmem can be allocated through two means:
  1) If an IOMMU unit has been probed, the IOMMU API is used to make memory
     pages contiguous to the GPU. This is the preferred way.
  2) If no IOMMU unit is probed, the DMA API is used to allocate physically
     contiguous memory.
  In both cases CPU read and writes are performed by creating a write-combined
  mapping. The GPU L2 cache must thus be flushedinvalidated when required. To
  be conservative we do this every time we acquire or release an instobj, but
  ideally L2 management should be handled at a higher level.
  To improve performance, CPU mappings are not removed upon instobj release.
  Instead they are placed into a LRU list to be recycled when the mapped space
  goes beyond a certain threshold. At the moment this limit is 1MB.
 CPU mapping 
  Used for objects allocated using the DMA API
  Used for objects flattened using the IOMMU API

	TODO: Figure out how to expose non-replayable fault buffer, which,
	       for some reason, is where recoverable CE faults appear...
	 
	  	It's a bit tricky, as both NVKM and SVM will need access to
	  	the non-replayable fault buffer.

	 If there's no LS FW managing bootstrapping of other LS falcons,
	  we depend on the HS firmware being able to do it instead.
 Which isn't possible everywhere... 
	 Determine layoutsize of WPR image up-front, as we need to know
	  it to allocate memory before we begin constructing it.
 Cull unknown falcons that are present in WPR image. 
 Ensure we've fetched falcon configuration. 
 Ensure the falcon that'll provide ACR functions is booted first. 
	 Cull falcons that can't be bootstrapped, or the HSFW can fail to
	  boot and leave the GPU in a weird state.
	 AllocateLocate WPR + fill ucode blob pointer.
	 
	   dGPU: allocate WPR + shadow blob
	  Tegra: locate WPR with regs, ensure size is sufficient,
	         allocate ucode blob.
 Write WPR to ucode blob. 
 Allocate instance block for ACR-related stuff. 
 Load HS firmware blobs into ACR VMM. 
 Kill temporary data. 
	 Pre-add LSFs in the order they appear in the FW WPR image so that
	  we're able to do a binary comparison with our own generator.

	  sclk to hclk) before reprogramming
 core: for the moment at least, always use nvpll 
	 shader: tie to nvclk if possible, otherwise use spll.  have to be
	  very careful that the shader clock is at least twice the core, or
	  some chipsets will be very unhappy.  i expect most or all of these

	  1. If voltage is increasing:
	  - safe frequency target matches the lowest - old - frequency
	  - DVFS settings are still old
	  - Voltage already increased to new level by volt, but maximum

	  - DVFS settings are still old

	  Interim step can be skipped if old frequency is below safe minimum,

	  wait for completion, and use results along with default slope to
	  calculate ADC offset during boot.
 Wait for internal calibration done (spec < 2us). 
 Compute and apply initial DVFS parameters 
 Forward declaration to detect speedo >=1 in gm20b_clk_init() 
 get out from IDDQ 
 Set the global bypass control to VCO 
 If not fused, set RAM SVOP PDP data 0x2, and enable fuse override 
 Disable idle slow down  
 speedo >= 1? 
 Get current voltage 
 Initialize DVFS 
 Start with lowest frequency 
 Speedo 0 only supports 12 voltages 
 FUSE register 
 No fused parameters, we will calibrate later 
 Integer part in mV + fractional part in uV 
 Integer part in mV + fractional part in 100uV 
 find lowest voltage we can use 
 find max frequency at this voltage 
 we are safe at 90% of the max frequency 
 Speedo 0 GPUs cannot use noise-aware PLL 
 Speedo >= 1, use NAPLL 
 duplicate the clock parameters since we will patch them below 
	
	  NAPLL can only work with max_u, clamp the m range so
	  gk20a_pllg_calc_mnp always uses it
	
	  we will calibrate during init - should never happen on
	  prod parts

 Process pending alarms. 
 Have we hit the earliest alarm that hasn't gone off? 
 Schedule it.  If we didn't race, we're done. 
		 Move to completed list.  We'll drop the lock before
		  executing the callback so it can reschedule itself.
 Shut down interrupt if no more pending alarms. 
 Execute completed callbacks. 
	 Remove alarm from pending list.
	 
	  This both protects against the corruption of the list,
	  and implements alarm reschedulingcancellation.
 Insert into pending list, ordered earliest to latest. 
 Update HW if this is now the earliest alarm. 
			 This shouldn't happen if callers aren't stupid.
			 
			  Worst case scenario is that it'll take roughly
			  4 seconds for the next alarm to trigger.

 This version of the shadow function disobeys the ACPI spec and tries
  to fetch in units of more than 4KiB at a time.  This is a LOT faster
  on some systems, such as Lenovo W530.
 Other systems, such as the one in fdo#55948, will report a success
  but only return 4KiB of data.  The common bios fetching logic will
  detect an invalid image, and fall back to this version of the read
  function.

  init parser control flow helpers
  init parser wrappers for normal registeri2cwhatever accessors
	 C51 (at least) sometimes has the lower bits set which the VBIOS
	  interprets to mean that access needs to go through certain IO
	  ports instead.  The NVIDIA binary driver has been seen to access
	  these through the NV register address, so lets assume we can
	  do the same
	 GF8+ display scripts need register addresses mangled a bit to
	  select a specific CRTCOR
 force head 0 for updates to cr44, it only exists on first head 
 select head 1 if cr44 write selected it 
  parsing of bios structures that are required to execute init tables
	 This appears to be the behaviour of the VBIOS parser, and is
	  important to cache the NV_PEXTDEV_BOOT0 on later chipsets to
	  avoid fucking up the memory controller (somehow) by reading it
	  on every INIT_RAM_RESTRICT_ZM_GROUP opcode.
	 
	  Preserving the non-caching behaviour on earlier chipsets just
	  in case not re-reading the strap causes similar breakage.
  utility functions used by various init opcode handlers
	 For mlv < 0x80, it is an index into a table of TMDS base addresses.
	  For mlv == 0x80 use the "or" value of the dcb_entry indexed by
	  CR58 for CR57 = 0 to index a table of offsets to the basic
	  0x6808b0 address.
	  For mlv == 0x81 use the "or" value of the dcb_entry indexed by
	  CR58 for CR57 = 0 to index a table of offsets to the basic
	  0x6808b0 address, and then flip the offset by 8.

		  v1.4 (some NV1516, NV11+) seems the same as v1.5, but
		  always has the same single (crt) entry, even when tv-out
		  present, so the conclusion is this version cannot really
		  be used.
		 
		  v1.2 tables (some NV610, and NV15+) normally have the
		  same 5 entries, which are not specific to the card and so
		  no use.
		 
		  v1.2 does have an I2C table that read_dcb_i2c_table can
		  handle, but cards exist (nv11 in #14821) with a bad i2c
		  table pointer, so use the indices parsed in
		  parse_bmp_structure.
		 
		  v1.1 (NV5+, maybe some NV4) is entirely unhelpful

 match dcb encoder type to mxm-ods device type 
	 digital output, have some extra stuff to match here, there's a
	  table in the vbios that provides a mapping from the mxm digital
	  connection enum values to SORlink
 check against sor index 
 check dcb entry has a compatible link field 
	 mark this descriptor accounted for by setting invalid device type,
	  except of course some manufactures don't follow specs properly and
	  we need to avoid killing off the TMDS function on DP connectors
	  if MXM-SIS is missing an entry for it.
 modify descriptor to match TMDS now 
	 look for an output device structure that matches this dcb entry.
	  if one isn't found, disable it.
	 modify the output's ddcaux port, there's a pointer to a table
	  with the mapping from mxm ddcaux port to dcb i2c_index in the
	  vbios mxm table
 override dcb sorconf.link, based on what mxm data says 
 Analog CRT 
 Analog TVHDTV 
	 we may need to fixup various other vbios tables based on what
	  the descriptor says the connector type should be.
	 
	  in a lot of cases, the vbios tables will claim DVI-I is possible,
	  and the mxm data says the connector is really HDMI.  another
	  common example is DP->eDP.

	 the init tables on some boards have INIT_RAM_RESTRICT_ZM_REG_GROUP
	  instructions which touch registers that may not even exist on
	  some configurations (Quadro 400), which causes the register
	  interface to screw up for some amount of time after attempting to
	  write to one of these, and results in all sorts of things going
	  horribly wrong.
	 
	  the binary driver avoids touching these registers at all, however,
	  the video bios doesn't care and does what the scripts say.  it's
	  presumed that the io-port access to init registers isn't effected
	  by the screw-up bug mentioned above.
	 
	  really, a new opcode should've been invented to handle these
	  requirements, but whatever, it's too late for that now.

 g84 and g86 report wrong information about what they support 
 The following only concerns PCIe cards. 
	 Tag field is 8-bit long, regardless of EXT_TAG.
	  However, if EXT_TAG is disabled, only the lower 5 bits of the tag
	  field should be used, limiting the number of request to 32.
	 
	  Apparently, 0x041c stores some limit on the number of requests
	  possible, so if EXT_TAG is disabled, limit that requests number to
	  32
	 
	  Fixes fdo#86537

 VIA Apollo PRO133x  GeForce FX 5600 Ultra - fdo#20341 
 SiS 761 does not support AGP cards, use PCI mode 
 Ensure AGP controller is in a consistent state in case we need to
  execute the VBIOS DEVINIT scripts.
	 First of all, disable fast writes, otherwise if it's already
	  enabled in the AGP bridge and we disable the card's AGP
	  controller we might be locking ourselves out of it.
 clear busmaster bit, and disable AGP 
 reset PGRAPH, PFIFO and PTIMER 
 and restore busmaster bit (gives effect of resetting AGP) 
	 Disable AGP by default on all PowerPC machines for now -- At
	  least some UniNorth-2 AGP bridges are known to be broken:
	  DMA from the host to the card works just fine, but writeback
	  from the card to the host goes straight to memory
	  untranslated bypassing that GATT somehow, making them quite
	  painful to deal with...
 acquire bridge temporarily, so that we can copy its info 
 determine if bridge + chipset combination needs a workaround 
 apply quirk  user-specified mode 
 AGPv3 
	 fast writes appear to be broken on nv18, they make the card
	  lock up randomly.

	 I8 format without an input LUT makes no sense, and the
	  HW error-checks for this.
	 
	  In order to handle legacy gamma, when there's no input
	  LUT we need to steal the output LUT and use it instead.
		 This should be an error, but there's legacy clients
		  that do a modeset before providing a gamma table.
		 
		  We keep the window disabled to avoid angering HW.
 Recalculate LUT state. 
 Handle setting base SET_OUTPUT_LUT_LO_ENABLE_USE_CORE_LUT. 
 Can't do an immediate flip while changing the LUT. 
	 Fetch the assembly state for the head the window will belong to,
	  and determine whether the window will be visible.
 Fetch assembly state for the head the window used to belong to. 
 LUT configuration can potentially cause the window to be disabled. 
 Calculate new window state. 
	 Aside from the obvious case where the window is actively being
	  disabled, we might also need to temporarily disable the window
	  when performing certain modeset operations.
 This function assumes the format has already been validated against the plane
  and the modifier was validated against the device-wides modifier list at FB
  creation time.

	  We don't want to accidentally wait for longer then the vblank, so
	  try again for the next vblank if we don't grab the lock
		
		  While Nvidia's documentation says CRCs are written on each
		  subsequent vblank after being enabled, in practice they
		  aren't written immediately.
	
	  We don't lose events if we aren't able to report CRCs until the
	  next vblank, so only report CRCs if the locks we need aren't
	  contended to prevent missing an actual vblank event
		
		  Unfortunately when notifier contexts are changed during CRC
		  capture, we will inevitably lose the CRC entry for the
		  frame where the hardware actually latched onto the first
		  UPDATE. According to Nvidia's hardware engineers, there's
		  no workaround for this.
		 
		  Now, we could try to be smart here and calculate the number
		  of missed CRCs based on audit timestamps, but those were
		  removed starting with volta. Since we always flush our
		  updates back-to-back without waiting, we'll just be
		  optimistic and assume we always miss exactly one frame.
		 CRC generation is still enabled in hw, we'll just report
		  any remaining CRC entries ourselves after it gets disabled
		  in hardware
	 While we don't care about entry tags, Volta+ hw always needs the
	  controlling wndw channel programmed to a wndw that's owned by our
	  head
			 TODO: once we support flexible channel ownership,
			  we should write some code here to handle attempting
			  to "steal" a plane: e.g. take a plane that is
			  currently not-visible and owned by another head,
			  and reassign it to this head. If we fail to do so,
			  we shuld reject the mode outright as CRC capture
			  then becomes impossible.
		
		  Re-programming ORs can't be done in the same flush as
		  disabling CRCs
 We handle mapping the memory for CRC notifiers ourselves, since each
  notifier needs it's own handle
	
	  Since we don't want the user to accidentally interrupt us as we're
	  disabling CRCs
		
		  If the user specified a custom flip threshold through

 Non-EDID LVDSeDP mode. 
	 For the user-specified mode, we must ignore doublescan and
	  the like, but honor frame packing.
 For the output mode, we can just use the stock helper. 
	 Add overscan compensation if necessary, will keep the aspect
	  ratio the same as the backend mode unless overridden by the
	  user setting both hborder and vborder properties.
	 Handle CENTERASPECT scaling, taking into account the areas
	  removed already for overscan compensation.
		 NOTE: This will cause scaling when the input is
		  larger than the output.
		 Determine whether the scaling should be on width or on
		  height. This is done by comparing the aspect ratios of the
		  sizes. If the output AR is larger than input AR, that means
		  we want to change the width (letterboxed on the
		  leftright), otherwise on the height (letterboxed on the
		  topbottom).
		 
		  E.g. 4:3 (1.333) AR image displayed on a 16:10 (1.6) AR
		  screen will have letterboxes on the leftright. However a
		  16:9 (1.777) AR image on that same screen will have
		  letterboxes on the topbottom.
		 
		  inputAR = iW  iH; outputAR = oW  oH
		  outputAR > inputAR is equivalent to oW  iH > iW  oH
 Recompute output width, i.e. leftright letterbox 
 Recompute output height, i.e. topbottom letterbox 
 Determine whether core output LUT should be enabled. 
		 Check if any window(s) have stolen the core output LUT
		  to as an input LUT for legacy gamma + I8 colour format.
			 If any window has stolen the core output LUT,
			  all of them must.
	
	  DRM modes are defined in terms of a repeating interval
	  starting with the active display area.  The hardware modes
	  are defined in terms of a repeating interval starting one
	  unit (pixel or line) into the sync pulse.  So, add bias.
XXX: Safe underestimate, even "0" works 
 Keep the legacy gamma size at 256 to avoid compatibility issues

		 Push buffer fetches are not coherent with BAR1, we need to ensure
		  writes have been flushed right through to VRAM before writing PUT.
 NVIDIA stay 5 away from GET, do the same. 
	 Wait for GET to depart from the beginning of the push buffer to
	  prevent writing PUT == GET, which would be ignored by HW.
 Corner-case, HW idle, but non-committed work pending. 
	 Pascal added support for 47-bit physical addresses, but some
	  parts of EVO still only accept 40-bit PAs.
	 
	  To avoid issues on systems with large amounts of RAM, and on
	  systems where an IOMMU maps pages at a high address, we need
	  to allocate push buffers in VRAM instead.
	 
	  This appears to match NVIDIA's behaviour on Pascal.
	 EVO channels are affected by a HW bug where the last 12 DWORDs
	  of the push buffer aren't able to be used safely.

	  The EFI GOP driver on newer GPUs configures window channels with a

	 FIXME: 256x256 cursors are supported on Kepler, however unlike Maxwell and later

	  proper fix for this is to teach nouveau to migrate fbs being used for the cursor plane to
	  small page allocations in prepare_fb(). When this is implemented, we should also force
	  large pages (128K) for ovly fbs in order to fix Kepler ovlys.
	  But until then, just limit cursors to 128x128 - which is small enough to avoid ever using

  misc hw access wrapperscontrol functions
 CR44 takes values 0 (head A), 3 (head B) and 4 (heads tied)
  it affects only the 8 bit vga io regs, which we access using mmio at
  0xc{0,2}3c, 0x60{1,3}3, and 0x68{1,3}3d
  in general, the set value of cr44 does not matter: reg access works as
  expected and values can be set for the appropriate head by using a 0x2000
  offset as required
  however:
  a) pre nv40, the head B range of PRMVIO regs at 0xc23c was not exposed and
     cr44 must be set to 0 or 3 for accessing values on the correct head
     through the common 0xc03c addresses
  b) in tied mode (4) head B is programmed to the values set on head A, and
     access using the head B addresses can have strange results, ergo we leave
     tied mode in init once we know to what cr44 should be restored on exit
  the owner parameter is slightly abused:
  0 and 1 are treated as head values and so the set value is (owner  3)
  other values are treated as literal values to set
		 This might seem stupid, but the blob does it and
		  omitting it often locks the system up.
 CR44 is always changed on CRTC0

  PLL getting
 to force parsing as single stage (i.e. nv40 vplls) pass pll2 as 0 
 log2P is & 0x7 as never more than 7, and nv3035 only uses 3 bits

 only 4 bits 
 check whether vpll has been forced into single stage mode 
 Avoid divide by zero if called at an inappropriate time 
	 the vpll on an unused head can come up with a random value, way
	  beyond the pll limits.  for some reason this causes the chip to
	  lock up when reading the dac palette regs, so set a valid pll here
	  when such a condition detected.  only seen on nv11 to date

 NV4x 0x40.. pll notes:

  vpll2: 0x4018 + 0x401c
  mpll: 0x4020 + 0x4024
  mpll: 0x4038 + 0x403c
  the first register of each pair has some unknown details:
  bits 0-7: redirected values from elsewhere? (similar to PLL_SETUP_CONTROL?)
  bits 20-23: (mpll) something to do with post divider?
  bits 28-31: related to single stage mode? (bit 812)
 NM2 == 0 is used to determine single stage mode on two stage plls 
	 for newer nv4x the blob uses only the first stage of the vpll below a
	  certain clock.  for a certain nv4b this is 150MHz.  since the max
	  output frequency of the first stage for this card is 300MHz, it is
	  assumed the threshold is given by vco1 maxfreq2
	 for early nv4x, specifically nv40 and some nv43 (devids 0 and 6,
	  not 8, others unknown), the blob always uses both plls.  no problem
	  has yet been observed in allowing the use a single stage pll on all
	  nv43 however.  the behaviour of single stage use is untested on nv40
 The blob uses this always, so let's do the same 
 again nv40 and some nv43 act more like nv3x as described above

	  blob uses, however we get given PM cursors so we use PM mode
		 hw gets unhappy if alpha <= rgb values.  for a PM image "less

 TV standard specific parameters 
  The following is some guesswork on how the TV encoder flicker
  filterrescaler works:
  It seems to use some sort of resampling filter, it is controlled
  through the registers at NV_PTV_HFILTER and NV_PTV_VFILTER, they
  control the horizontal and vertical stage respectively, there is
  also NV_PTV_HFILTER2 the blob fills identically to NV_PTV_HFILTER,
  but they seem to do nothing. A rough guess might be that they could
  be used to independently control the filtering of each interlaced
  field, but I don't know how they are enabled. The whole filtering
  process seems to be disabled with bits 26:27 of PTV_200, but we
  aren't doing that.
  The layout of both register sets is the same:
  A: [BASE+0x18]...[BASE+0x0] [BASE+0x58]..[BASE+0x40]
  B: [BASE+0x34]...[BASE+0x1c] [BASE+0x74]..[BASE+0x5c]
  Each coefficient is stored in bits [31],[15:9] in two's complement
  format. They seem to be some kind of weights used in a low-pass
  filter. Both A and B coefficients are applied to the 14 nearest
  samples on each side (Listed from nearest to furthermost.  They
  roughly cover 2 framebuffer pixels on each side).  They are
  probably multiplied with some more hardwired weights before being
  used: B-coefficients are applied the same on both sides,
  A-coefficients are inverted before being applied to the opposite
  side.
  After all the hassle, I got the following formula by empirical
  means...

  Some userspace rendering loops runs all displays in the same loop.
  This means that a fast display will have to wait for a slow one.
  For this reason gud does flushing asynchronous by default.
  The down side is that in e.g. a single display setup userspace thinks
  the display is insanely fast since the driver reports back immediately
  that the flushpageflip is done. This wastes CPU and power.
  Such users might want to set this module parameter to false.
  FIXME: The driver is probably broken on Big Endian machines.

	  This assumes that if we're switching to 2D, we're switching
	  away from 3D, and vice versa.  Hence, if we're switching to
	  the 2D core, we need to flush the 3D depth and color caches,
	  otherwise we need to flush the 2D pixel engine cache.
  Safely replace the WAIT of a waitlink with a new command and argument.
  The GPU may be executing this WAIT while we're modifying it, so we have
  to write it in a specific order to avoid the GPU branching to somewhere
  else.  'wl_offset' is the offset to the first byte of the WAIT command.
  Ensure that there is space in the command buffer to contiguously write
  'cmd_dwords' 64-bit words into the buffer, wrapping if necessary.

 Replace the last link-wait with an "END" command

 Update the link target to point to above instructions 
	
	  Append a LINK to the submitted command buffer to return to

	  There is some sort of corner case behavior of the controller,
	  which could rarely be triggered at least on i.MX6SX connected
	  to 800x480 DPI panel and i.MX8MM connected to DPI->DSI->LVDS
	  bridged 1920x1080 panel (and likely on other setups too), where
	  the image on the panel shifts to the right and wraps around.
	  This happens either when the controller is enabled on boot or
	  even later during run time. The condition does not correct
	  itself automatically, i.e. the display image remains shifted.
	 
	  It seems this problem is known and is due to sporadic underflows
	  of the LCDIF FIFO. While the LCDIF IP does have underflowoverflow
	  IRQs, neither of the IRQs trigger and neither IRQ status bit is
	  asserted when this condition occurs.
	 
	  All known revisions of the LCDIF IP have CTRL1 RECOVER_ON_UNDERFLOW
	  bit, which is described in the reference manual since i.MX23 as
	  "
	    Set this bit to enable the LCDIF block to recover in the next
	    fieldframe if there was an underflow in the current fieldframe.
	  "
	  Enable this bit to mitigate the sporadic underflows.
	
	  Even if we disable the controller here, it will still continue
	  until its FIFOs are running out of data
  Clear the bit and poll it cleared.  This is usually called with
  a reset address and mask being either SFTRST(bit 31) or CLKGATE
  (bit 30).
	
	  It seems, you can't re-program the controller if it is still
	  running. This may lead to shifted pictures (FIFO issue?), so
	  first stop the controller and drain its FIFOs.

	  Slave iommu shares power, irq and clock with vop.  It was associated
	  automatically with this master device via common driver code.
	  Now that we have enabled the clock we attach it to the shared drm
	  mapping.
	
	  We need to make sure that all windows are disabled before we
	  enable the crtc. Otherwise we might try to scan from a destroyed
	  buffer later.
	 
	  In the case of enable-after-PSR, we don't need to worry about this
	  case since the buffer is guaranteed to be valid and disabling the
	  window will result in screen glitches on PSR exit.
		
		  Disable AFBC and forget there was a vop window with AFBC
	
	  At here, vop clock & iommu is enable, RW vop regs would be safe.
	
	  Vop standby will take effect at end of current frame,
	  if dsp hold valid irq happen, it means standby complete.
	 
	  we must wait standby complete when we want to disable aclk,
	  if not, memory bus maybe dead.
	
	  vop standby complete, so iommu detach is safe.
	
	  Src.x1 can be odd when do clip, but yuv plane start point
	  need align with 2 pixel.
	
	  can't update plane when vop is disabled.
	
	  For y-mirroring we need to move address
	  to the beginning of the last line.
	
	  Blending win0 with the background color doesn't seem to work
	  correctly. We only get the background color, no matter the contents
	  of the win0 framebuffer.  However, blending pre-multiplied color
	  with the default opaque black default background color is a no-op,
	  so we can just disable blending to get the correct result.
 Special case for asynchronous cursor updates. 
		
		  A scanout can still be occurring, so we can't drop the
		  reference to the old framebuffer. To solve this we get a
		  reference to old_fb and set a worker to release it later.
		  FIXME: if we perform 500 async_update calls before the
		  vblank, then we can have 500 different framebuffers waiting
		  to be released.
	
	  Clock craziness.
	 
	  Key points:
	 
	  - DRM works in in kHz.
	  - Clock framework works in Hz.
	  - Rockchip's clock driver picks the clock rate that is the
	    same _OR LOWER_ than the one requested.
	 
	  Action plan:
	 
	  1. Try to set the exact rate first, and confirm the clock framework
	     can provide it.
	 
	  2. If the clock framework cannot provide the exact rate, we should
	     add 999 Hz to the requested rate.  That way if the clock we need
	     is 60000001 Hz (~60 MHz) and DRM tells us to make 60000 kHz then
	     the clock framework will actually give us the right clock.
	 
	  3. Get the clock framework to round the rate for us to tell us
	     what it will actually make.
	 
	  4. Store the rounded up rate so that we don't need to worry about
	     this in the actual clk_set_rate().
	
	  To disable gamma (gamma_lut is null) or to write
	  an update to the LUT, clear dsp_lut_en.
	
	  In order to write the LUT to the internal memory,
	  we need to first make sure the dsp_lut_en bit is cleared.
	
	  Only update GAMMA if the 'active' flag is not changed,
	  otherwise it's updated by .atomic_enable.
	
	  If we have a GAMMA LUT in the state, then let's make sure
	  it's updated. We might be coming out of suspend,
	  which means the LUT internal memory needs to be re-written.
	
	  if vop is not support RGB10 output, need force RGB10 to RGB888.
	
	  Spin until frame start interrupt status bit goes low, which means
	  that interrupt handler was invoked and cleared it. The timeout of
	  10 msecs is really too long, but it is just a safety measure if
	  something goes really wrong. The wait will only happen in the very
	  unlikely case of a vblank happening exactly at the same time and
	  shouldn't exceed microseconds range.
 Enable AFBC if there is some AFBC window, disable otherwise. 
	
	  There is a (rather unlikely) possiblity that a vblank interrupt
	  fired before we set the cfg_done bit. To avoid spuriously
	  signalling flip completion we need to wait for it to finish.
	
	  The irq is shared with the iommu. If the runtime-pm state of the
	  vop-device is disabled the irq has to be targeted at the iommu.
	
	  interrupt register has interrupt status, enable and clear bits, we
	  must hold irq_lock to avoid a race with enabledisable_vblank().
 Clear all active interrupt sources 
 This is expected for vop iommu irqs, since the irq is shared 
 Unhandled irqs are spurious. 
	
	  Create drm_plane for primary and cursor planes first, since we need
	  to pass them to drm_crtc_init_with_planes, which sets the
	  "possible_crtcs" to the newly initialized crtc.
	
	  Create drm_planes for overlay windows with possible_crtcs restricted
	  to the newly created crtc.
	
	  We need to cleanup the planes now.  Why?
	 
	  The planes are "&vop->win[i].base".  That means the memory is
	  all part of the big "struct vop" chunk of memory.  That memory
	  was devm allocated and associated with this component.  We need to
	  free it ourselves before vop_unbind() finishes.
	
	  Destroy CRTC after vop_plane_destroy() since vop_disable_plane()
	  references the CRTC.
 Enable both the hclk and aclk to setup the vop 
	
	  do hclk_reset, reset all vop registers.
	
	  do dclk_reset, let all config take affect.
  Initialize the vop->win array elements.

   TDA9950 Consumer Electronics Control driver
  The NXP TDA9950 implements the HDMI Consumer Electronics Control
  interface.  The host interface is similar to a mailbox: the data
  registers starting at REG_CDR0 are written to send a command to the
  internal CPU, and replies are read from these registers.
  As the data registers represent a mailbox, they must be accessed
  as a single I2C transaction.  See the TDA9950 data sheet for details.
	
	  This should never happen: the data sheet says that there will
	  always be a valid message if the interrupt line is asserted.

 TDA9950 doesn't want address 15 set 
  When operating as part of the TDA998x, we need additional handling
  to initialise and shut down the TDA9950 part of the device.  These

  activities.

  When operating as part of the TDA998x, we need to claim additional
  resources.  These two hooks permit the management of those resources.
	
	  We must have I2C functionality: our multi-byte accesses
	  must be performed as a single contiguous transaction.
 We must have an interrupt to be functional. 
	
	  If we're part of a TDA998x, we want the class devices to be
	  associated with the HDMI Tx so we have a tight relationship
	  between the HDMI interface and the CEC interface.

 The TDA9988 series of devices use a paged register scheme.. to simplify
  things we encode the page # in upper bits of the register #.  To read
  write a given register, we need to make sure CURPAGE register is set
  appropriately.  Which implies readswrites are not atomic.  Fun!

 Device versions: 
 Enable automatic calibration mode 
 Enable free running oscillator 
  Calibration for the internal oscillator: we need to set calibration mode,
  and then pulse the IRQ line low for a 10ms ± 1% period.
 This is the maximum size of the buffer passed in 
 reset audio and i2c master: 
 reset transmitter: 
 PLL registers common configuration 
 Write the default value MUX register 
  The TDA998x has a problem when trying to read the EDID close to a
  HPD assertion: it needs a delay of 100ms to avoid timing out while
  trying to read EDID data.
  However, tda998x_connector_get_modes() may be called at any moment
  after tda998x_connector_detect() indicates that we are connected, so
  we need to delay probing modes in tda998x_connector_get_modes() after
  we have seen a HPD inactive->active transition.  This code implements
  that delay.
  We need to run the KMS hotplug event helper outside of our threaded
  interrupt routine as this can call back into our get_modes method,
  which will want to make use of interrupts.
  only 2 interrupts may occur: screen plugunplug and EDID read
 Audio support 
 Configure the TDA998x audio data and clock routing. 
  The audio clock divisor register controls a divider producing Audio_Clk_Out
  from SERclk by dividing it by 2^n where 0 <= n <= 5.  We don't know what
  Audio_Clk_Out or SERclk are. We guess SERclk is the same as TMDS clock.
  It seems that Audio_Clk_Out must be the smallest value that is greater
  than 128fs, otherwise audio does not function. There is some suggestion
  that 126fs is a better value.
  In auto-CTS mode, the TDA998x uses a "measured time stamp" counter to
  generate the CTS value.  It appears that the "measured time stamp" is
  the number of TDMS clock cycles within a number of audio input clock
  cycles defined by the k and N parameters defined below, in a similar
  way to that which is set out in the CTS generation in the HDMI spec.
   tmdsclk ----> mts -> m ---> CTS
                  ^
   sclk -> k -> N
  CTS = mts  m, where m is 2^M.
  k is a divider based on the K value below, K+1 for K < 4, or 8 for K >= 4
  N is a divider based on the HDMI specified N value.
  This produces the following equation:
   CTS = tmds_clock  k  N  (sclk  m)
  When combined with the sink-side equation, and realising that sclk is
  bclk_ratio  fs, we end up with:
   k = m  bclk_ratio  128.
  Note: SPDIF always uses a bclk_ratio of 64.
 If audio is not configured, there is nothing to do. 
 Enable audio ports 
 auto CTS 
	
	  This is the approximate value of N, which happens to be
	  the recommended values for non-coherent clocks.
 Write the CTS and N values 
 Reset CTS generator 
	 Write the channel status
	  The REG_CH_STAT_B-registers skip IEC958 AES2 byte, because
	  there is a separate register for each I2S wire.

 enable reading EDID: 
 flag must be cleared by sw: 
 wait for block read to complete: 
	
	  If we get killed while waiting for the HPD timeout, return
	  no modes found: we are not in a restartable path, so we
	  can't handle signals gracefully.

	  Since we are "computer" like, our source invariably produces
	  full-range RGB.  If the monitor supports full-range, then use
	  it, otherwise reduce to limited-range.
	
	  Internally TDA998x is using ITU-R BT.656 style sync but
	  we get VESA style sync. TDA998x is using a reference pixel
	  relative to ITU to sync to the input frame and for output
	  sync generation. Currently, we are using reference detection
	  from HSVS, i.e. REFPIXREFLINE denote frame start sync point
	  which is position of rising VS with coincident rising HS.
	 
	  Now there is some issues to take care of:
	  - HDMI data islands require sync-before-active
	  - TDA998x register values must be > 0 to be enabled
	  - REFLINE needs an additional offset of +1
	  - REFPIX needs an addtional offset of +1 for UYUV and +3 for RGB
	 
	  So we add +1 to all horizontal and vertical register values,
	  plus an additional +3 for REFPIX as we are using RGB input only.
	
	  Attached LCD controllers may generate broken sync. Allow
	  those to adjust the position of the rising VS edge by adding
	  HSKEW to ref_pix.
	
	  Select pixel repeat depending on the double-clock flag
	  (which means we have to repeat each pixel once.)
 the TMDS clock is scaled up by the pixel repeat 
	
	  The divisor is power-of-2. The TDA9983B datasheet gives
	  this as ranges of Msamples, which is 10x the TMDS clock:
	    0 - 800 to 1500 Msamples
	    1 - 400 to 800 Msamples
	    2 - 200 to 400 Msamples
	    3 - as 2 above
 mute the audio FIFO: 
 set HDMI HDCP mode off: 
 no pre-filter or interpolator: 
 set color matrix according to output rgb quant range 
 set BIAS tmds value: 
	
	  Sync on rising HSYNCVSYNC
	
	  TDA19988 requires high-active sync at input stage,
	  so invert low-active sync provided by master encoder here
 let incoming pixels fill the active space (if any) 
	
	  Always generate sync polarity relative to input sync and
	  revert input stage toggled sync at output stage
 must be last register set: 
	 CEA-861B section 6 says that:
	  CEA version 1 (CEA-861) has no support for infoframes.
	  CEA version 2 (CEA-861A) supports version 1 AVI infoframes,
	  and optional basic audio.
	  CEA version 3 (CEA-861B) supports version 1 and 2 AVI infoframes,
	  and optional digital audio, with audio infoframes.
	 
	  Since we only support generation of version 2 AVI infoframes,
	  ignore CEA version 2 and below (iow, behave as if we're a
	  CEA-861 source.)

	  Some TDA998x are actually two I2C devices merged onto one piece
	  of silicon: TDA9989 and TDA19989 combine the HDMI transmitter
	  with a slightly modified TDA9950 CEC device.  The CEC device
	  is at the TDA9950 address, with the address pins strapped across
	  to the TDA998x address pins.  Hence, it always has the same
	  offset.

 Algorithm:
  We store the last allocated bo in "hole", we always try to allocate
  after the last allocated bo. Principle is that in a linear GPU ring
  progression was is after last is the oldest bo we allocated and thus
  the first one that should no longer be in use by the GPU.
  If it's not the case we skip over the bo after last to the closest
  done bo if such one exist. If none exist and we are not asked to
  block we report failure to allocate.
  If we are asked to block we wait on all the oldest fence of all
  rings. We just wait for any of those fence to complete.

  evergreen cards need to use the 3D engine to blit data which requires
  quite a bit of hw state setup.  Rather than pull the whole 3D driver
  (which normally generates the 3D state) into the DRM, we opt to use
  statically generated state tables.  The register state and shaders
  were hand generated to support blitting functionality.  See the 3D
  driver or documentation for descriptions of the registers and
  shader instructions.

  GPUVM
  GPUVM is similar to the legacy gart on older asics, however
  rather than there being a single global gart table
  for the entire GPU, there are multiple VM page tables active
  at any given time.  The VM page tables can contain a mix
  vram pages and system memory pages and system memory pages
  can be mapped as snooped (cached system pages) or unsnooped
  (uncached system pages).
  Each VM has an ID associated with it and there is a page table
  associated with each VMID.  When execting a command buffer,
  the kernel tells the ring what VMID to use for that command
  buffer.  VMIDs are allocated dynamically as commands are submitted.
  The userspace drivers maintain their own address space and the kernel
  sets up their pages tables accordingly when they submit their
  command buffers and a VMID is assigned.
  CaymanTrinity support up to 8 active VMs at any given time;
  SI supports 16.

	  The MC L1 TLB supports variable sized pages, based on a fragment
	  field in the PTE. When this field is set to a non-zero value, page
	  granularity is increased from 4KB to (1 << (12 + frag)). The PTE
	  flags are considered valid for all PTEs within the fragment range
	  and corresponding mappings are assumed to be physically contiguous.
	 
	  The L1 TLB can store a single PTE for the whole fragment,
	  significantly increasing the space available for translation
	  caching. This leads to large improvements in throughput when the
	  TLB is under pressure.
	 
	  The L2 TLB distributes small and large fragments into two
	  asymmetric partitions. The large fragment cache is significantly
	  larger. Thus, we try to use large fragments wherever possible.
	  Userspace can support this by aligning virtual base address and
	  allocation size to the fragment size.

  evergreen cards need to use the 3D engine to blit data which requires
  quite a bit of hw state setup.  Rather than pull the whole 3D driver
  (which normally generates the 3D state) into the DRM, we opt to use
  statically generated state tables.  The register state and shaders
  were hand generated to support blitting functionality.  See the 3D
  driver or documentation for descriptions of the registers and
  shader instructions.

 This is based on the bucket sort with O(n) time complexity.
  An item with priority "i" is added to bucket[i]. The lists are then
  concatenated in descending order.
	 Since buffers which appear sooner in the relocation list are
	  likely to be used more often than buffers which appear later
	  in the list, the sort mustn't change the ordering of buffers
	  with the same priority, i.e. it must be stable.
 Connect the sorted buckets in the output list. 
 FIXME: we assume that each relocs use 4 dwords 
		 The userspace buffer priorities are from 0 to 15. A higher
		  number means the buffer is more important.
		  Also, the buffers used for write have a higher priority than
		  the buffers used for read only, which doubles the range
		  to 0 to 31. 32 is reserved for the kernel driver.
		 The first reloc of an UVD job is the msg and that must be in
		  VRAM, the second reloc is the DPB and for WMV that must be in
		  VRAM as well. Also put everything into VRAM on AGP cards and older
		  IGP chips to avoid image corruptions
 TODO: is this still needed for NI+ ? 
 prioritize this over any other relocation 
 Objects shared as dma-bufs cannot be moved to VRAM 
 TODO: only use the low priority ring for now 
 XXX: note that this is called from the legacy UMS CS ioctl as well

 Sort A before B if A is smaller. 
  radeon_cs_parser_fini() - clean parser states
  @parser:	parser structure holding parsing context.
  @error:	error number
  @backoff:	indicator to backoff the reservation
  If error is set than unvalidate buffer, otherwise just free memory
  used by parsing context.
		 Sort the buffer list from the smallest to largest buffer,
		  which affects the order of buffers in the LRU list.
		  This assures that the smallest buffers are added first
		  to the LRU list, so they are likely to be later evicted
		  first, instead of large buffers whose eviction is more
		  expensive.
		 
		  This slightly lowers the number of bytes moved by TTM
		  per frame under memory pressure.

  radeon_cs_packet_parse() - parse cp packet and point ib index to next packet

  @pkt:	where to store packet information
  @idx:	packet index

  radeon_cs_packet_next_is_pkt3_nop() - test if the next packet is P3 NOP
  @p:		structure holding the parser context.
  Check if the next packet is NOP relocation packet3.
  radeon_cs_dump_packet() - dump raw packet context
  @p:		structure holding the parser context.
  @pkt:	structure holding the packet.
  Used mostly for debugging and error reporting.
  radeon_cs_packet_next_reloc() - parse next (should be reloc) packet
  @p:			parser structure holding parsing context.
  @cs_reloc:		reloc informations

  DVI is complicated
  Do a DDC probe, if DDC probe passes, get the full EDID so
  we can do analogdigital monitor detection at this point.
  If the monitor is an analog monitor or we got no DDC,
  we need to find the DAC encoder object for this connector.
  If we got no DDC, we do load detection on the DAC encoder object.
  If we got analog DDC or load detection passes on the DAC encoder
  we have to check if this analog encoder is shared with anyone else (TV)
  if its shared we have to set the other connector to disconnected.
		 Sometimes the pins required for the DDC probe on DVI
		  connectors don't make contact at the same time that the ones
		  for HPD do. If the DDC probe fails even though we had an HPD

			  DDC line.  The latter is more complex because with DVI<->HDMI adapters
			  you don't really know what's connected to which port as both are digital.

 sdma 
  sDMA - System DMA
  Starting with CIK, the GPU has new asynchronous
  DMA engines.  These engines are used for compute
  and gfx.  There are two DMA engines (SDMA0, SDMA1)
  and each one supports 1 ring buffer used for gfx
  and 2 queues used for compute.
  The programming model is very similar to the CP
  (ring buffer, IBs, etc.), but sDMA has it's own
  packet format that is different from the PM4 format
  used by the CP. sDMA supports copying data, writing
  embedded data, solid fills, and a number of other
  things.  It also has support for tilingdetiling of
  buffers.

	  Line Buffer Setup
	  There are 3 line buffers, each one shared by 2 display controllers.
	  DC_LB_MEMORY_SPLIT controls how that line buffer is shared between
	  the display controllers.  The paritioning is done via one of four
	  preset allocations specified in bits 2:0:
	  first display controller
	   0 - first half of lb (3840  2)
	   1 - first 34 of lb (5760  2)
	   2 - whole lb (7680  2), other crtc must be disabled
	   3 - first 14 of lb (1920  2)
	  second display controller
	   4 - second half of lb (3840  2)
	   5 - second 34 of lb (5760  2)
	   6 - whole lb (7680  2), other crtc must be disabled
	   7 - last 14 of lb (1920  2)
	 this can get tricky if we have two large displays on a paired group
	  of crtcs.  Ideally for multiple large displays we'd assign them to
	  non-linked crtcs for maximum line buffer allocation.

	  Line Buffer Setup
	  There are 3 line buffers, each one shared by 2 display controllers.
	  DC_LB_MEMORY_SPLIT controls how that line buffer is shared between
	  the display controllers.  The paritioning is done via one of four
	  preset allocations specified in bits 21:20:
	   0 - half lb
	   2 - whole lb, other crtc must be disabled
	 this can get tricky if we have two large displays on a paired group
	  of crtcs.  Ideally for multiple large displays we'd assign them to
	  non-linked crtcs for maximum line buffer allocation.

  radeon_unpin_work_func - unpin old buffer object
  @__work: kernel work item
  Unpin the old frame buffer object outside of the interrupt handler
 unpin of the old buffer 
 can happen during initialization 
	 Skip the pageflip completion check below (based on polling) on
	  asics which reliably support hw pageflip completion irqs. pflip
	  irqs are a reliable and race-free method of handling pageflip
	  completion detection. A use_pflipirq module parameter < 2 allows
	  to override this in case of asics with faulty pflip irqs.
	  A module parameter of 0 would only use this polling based path,
	  a parameter of 1 would use pflip irq only as a backup to this
	  path, as in Linux 3.16.
	 Has the pageflip already completed in crtc, or is it certain
	  to complete in this vblank? GET_DISTANCE_TO_VBLANKSTART provides
	  distance to start of "fudged earlier" vblank in vpos, distance to
	  start of real vblank in hpos. vpos >= 0 && hpos < 0 means we are in
	  the last few scanlines before start of real vblank, where the vblank
	  irq can fire, so we have sampled update_pending a bit too early and
	  know the flip will complete at leading edge of the upcoming real
	  vblank. On pre-AVIVO hardware, flips also complete inside the real
	  vblank, not only at leading edge, so if update_pending for hpos >= 0
	   == inside real vblank, the flip will complete almost immediately.
	  Note that this method of completion handling is still not 100% race
	  free, as we could execute before the radeon_flip_work_func managed
	  to run and set the RADEON_FLIP_SUBMITTED status, thereby we no-op,
	  but the flip still gets programmed into hw and completed during
	  vblank, leading to a delayed emission of the flip completion event.
	  This applies at least to pre-AVIVO hardware, where flips are always
	  completing inside vblank, not only at leading edge of vblank.
		 crtc didn't flip in this target vblank interval,
		  but flip is pending in crtc. Based on the current
		  scanout position we know that the current frame is
		  (nearly) complete and the flip will (likely)
		  complete before the start of the next frame.

	 Wait until we're out of the vertical blank period before the one
	  targeted by the flip. Always wait on pre DCE4 to avoid races with

  Retrieve current video scanout position of crtc on a given gpu, and
  an optional accurate timestamp of when query happened.
  \param dev Device to query.
  \param crtc Crtc to query.
  \param flags Flags from caller (DRM_CALLED_FROM_VBLIRQ or 0).
               For driver internal use only also supports these flags:
               USE_REAL_VBLANKSTART to use the real start of vblank instead
               of a fudged earlier start of vblank.
               GET_DISTANCE_TO_VBLANKSTART to return distance to the
               fudged earlier start of vblank in vpos and the distance
               to true start of vblank in hpos.
  \param vpos Location where vertical scanout position should be stored.
  \param hpos Location where horizontal scanout position should go.
  \param stime Target location for timestamp taken immediately before
                scanout position query. Can be NULL to skip timestamp.
  \param etime Target location for timestamp taken immediately after
                scanout position query. Can be NULL to skip timestamp.
  Returns vpos as a positive number while in active scanout area.
  Returns vpos as a negative number inside vblank, counting the number
  of scanlines to go until end of vblank, e.g., -1 means "one scanline
  until start of active scanout  end of vblank."
  \return Flags, or'ed together as follows:
  DRM_SCANOUTPOS_VALID = Query successful.
  DRM_SCANOUTPOS_INVBL = Inside vblank.
  DRM_SCANOUTPOS_ACCURATE = Returned position is accurate. A lack of
  this flag means that returned position may be offset by a constant but
  unknown small number of scanlines wrt. real scanout position.
 preempt_disable_rt() should go right here in PREEMPT_RT patchset. 
 Get optional system timestamp before query. 
 Pre-AVIVO: Different encoding of scanout pos and vblank interval. 
			 Assume vbl_end == 0, get vbl_start from
			  upper 16 bits.
 Only retrieve vpos from upper 16 bits, set hpos == 0. 
 Get optional system timestamp after query. 
 preempt_enable_rt() should go right here in PREEMPT_RT patchset. 
 Decode into vertical and horizontal scanout position. 
 Valid vblank area boundaries from gpu retrieved? 
 Yes: Decode. 
 No: Fake something reasonable which gives at least ok results. 
 Called from driver internal vblank counter query code? 
 Caller wants distance from real vbl_start in hpos 
	 Fudge vblank to start a few scanlines earlier to handle the
	  problem that vblank irqs fire a few scanlines before start
	  of vblank. Some driver internal callers need the true vblank
	  start to be used and signal this via the USE_REAL_VBLANKSTART flag.
	 
	  The cause of the "early" vblank irq is that the irq is triggered
	  by the line buffer logic when the line buffer read position enters
	  the vblank, whereas our crtc scanout position naturally lags the
	  line buffer read position.
 Test scanout position against vblank region. 
 In vblank? 
 Called from driver internal vblank counter query code? 
 Caller wants distance from fudged earlier vbl_start 
	 Check if inside vblank area and apply corrective offsets:
	  vpos will then be >=0 in video scanout area, but negative
	  within vblank area, counting down the number of lines until
	  start of scanout.
 Inside "upper part" of vblank area? Apply corrective offset if so: 
 Correct for shifted end of vbl at vbl_end.

  Rings
  Most engines on the GPU are fed via ring buffers.  Ring
  buffers are areas of GPU accessible memory that the host
  writes commands into and the GPU reads commands out of.
  There is a rptr (read pointer) that determines where the
  GPU is currently reading, and a wptr (write pointer)
  which determines where the host has written.  When the
  pointers are equal, the ring is idle.  When the host
  writes commands to the ring buffer, it increments the
  wptr.  The GPU then starts fetching commands and executes
  them until the pointers are equal again.
  radeon_ring_supports_scratch_reg - check if the ring supports
  writing to scratch registers
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: radeon_ring structure holding ring information
  Check if a specific ring supports writing to scratch registers (all asics).
  Returns true if the ring supports writing to scratch regs, false if not.
  radeon_ring_free_size - update the free size
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: radeon_ring structure holding ring information
  Update the free dw slots in the ring buffer (all asics).
 This works because ring_size is a power of 2 
 this is an empty ring 
  update lockup info to avoid false positive 
  radeon_ring_alloc - allocate space on the ring buffer
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: radeon_ring structure holding ring information
  @ndw: number of dwords to allocate in the ring buffer
  Allocate @ndw dwords in the ring buffer (all asics).
  Returns 0 on success, error on failure.
 make sure we aren't trying to allocate more space than there is on the ring 
	 Align requested size with padding so unlock_commit can
  radeon_ring_lock - lock the ring and allocate space on it
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: radeon_ring structure holding ring information
  @ndw: number of dwords to allocate in the ring buffer
  Lock the ring and allocate @ndw dwords in the ring buffer
  (all asics).
  Returns 0 on success, error on failure.
  radeon_ring_commit - tell the GPU to execute the new
  commands on the ring buffer
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: radeon_ring structure holding ring information
  @hdp_flush: Whether or not to perform an HDP cache flush
  Update the wptr (write pointer) to tell the GPU to
  execute new commands on the ring buffer (all asics).
	 If we are emitting the HDP flush via the ring buffer, we need to
	  do it before padding.
 We pad to match fetch size 
	 If we are emitting the HDP flush via MMIO, we need to do it after
	  all CPU writes to VRAM finished.
  radeon_ring_unlock_commit - tell the GPU to execute the new
  commands on the ring buffer and unlock it
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: radeon_ring structure holding ring information
  @hdp_flush: Whether or not to perform an HDP cache flush

  @ring: radeon_ring structure holding ring information
  Reset the driver's copy of the wptr (all asics).
  radeon_ring_unlock_undo - reset the wptr and unlock the ring

  @rdev:       radeon device structure
  @ring: radeon_ring structure holding ring information
  Update the last rptr value and timestamp (all asics).
  radeon_ring_test_lockup() - check if ring is lockedup by recording information
  @rdev:       radeon device structure
  @ring:       radeon_ring structure holding ring information
 ring is still working, no lockup 
 give a chance to the GPU ... 
  radeon_ring_backup - Back up the content of a ring
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: the ring we want to back up
  @data: placeholder for returned commit data
  Saves all unprocessed commits from a ring, returns the number of dwords saved.
 just in case lock the ring 
 it doesn't make sense to save anything if all fences are signaled 
 calculate the number of dw on the ring 
 no way to read back the next rptr 
 and then save the content of the ring 
  radeon_ring_restore - append saved commands to the ring again
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: ring to append commands to
  @size: number of dwords we want to write
  @data: saved commands
  Allocates space on the ring and restore the previously saved commands.

  @rdev: radeon device structure holding all necessary informations
  @mc: memory controller structure holding memory informations
  Function will place try to place VRAM at same place as in CPU (PCI)
  address space as some GPU seems to have issue when we reprogram at
  different address space.
  If there is not enough space to fit the unvisible VRAM after the
  aperture then we limit the VRAM size to the aperture.
  If we are using AGP then place VRAM adjacent to AGP aperture are we need
  them to be in one from GPU point of view so that we can program GPU to
  catch access outside them (weird GPU policy see ??).
  This function will never fails, worst case are limiting VRAM or GTT.
  Note: GTT start, end, size should be initialized before calling this
  function on AGP platform.

  Interrupts
  Interrupts use a ring buffer on r6xxr7xx hardware.  It works pretty
  the same as the CP ring buffer, but in reverse.  Rather than the CPU
  writing to the ring and the GPU consuming, the GPU writes to the ring
  and host consumes.  As the host irq handler processes interrupts, it
  increments the rptr.  When the rptr catches up with the wptr, all the
  current interrupts have been processed.

  r600_mmio_hdp_flush - flush Host Data Path cache via MMIO
  @rdev: radeon device structure
  Some R6XXR7XX don't seem to take into account HDP flushes performed
  through the ring buffer. This leads to corruption in rendering, see
  http:bugzilla.kernel.orgshow_bug.cgi?id=15186 . To avoid this, we
  directly perform the HDP flush by writing the register through MMIO.

 Firmware Names 
 This files gather functions specifics to:
  r100,rv100,rs100,rv200,rs200,r200,rv250,rs300,rv280
  and others in some cases.

 Load the microcode for the CP 
 Align ring size 
	 Each time the cp read 1024 bytes (16 dwordquadword) update
 cp will read 128bytes at a time (4 dwords) 
 Write to CP_RB_WPTR will be delayed for pre_write_timer clocks 
	 Force CP_RB_WPTR write if written more than one time before the
	  delay expire
	 Setup the cp cache like this (cache size is 96 dwords) :
	 	RING		0  to 15
	 	INDIRECT1	16 to 79
	 	INDIRECT2	80 to 95
	  So ring cache size is 16dwords (> (2  max_fetch = 2  4dwords))
	     indirect1 cache size is 64dwords (> (2  max_fetch = 2  4dwords))
	     indirect2 cache size is 16dwords (> (2  max_fetch = 2  4dwords))
	  Idea being that most of the gpu cmd will be through indirect1 buffer
	  so it gets the bigger cache.

 Set ring address 
 Force read & write ptr to 0

  IB
  IBs (Indirect Buffers) and areas of GPU accessible memory where
  commands are stored.  You can put a pointer to the IB in the
  command ring and the hw will fetch the commands from the IB
  and execute them.  Generally userspace acceleration drivers
  produce command buffers which are send to the kernel and
  put in IBs for execution by the requested ring.
  radeon_ib_get - request an IB (Indirect Buffer)
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: ring index the IB is associated with
  @vm: requested vm
  @ib: IB object returned
  @size: requested IB size
  Request an IB (all asics).  IBs are allocated using the
  suballocator.
  Returns 0 on success, error on failure.
		 ib pool is bound at RADEON_VA_IB_OFFSET in virtual address
		  space and soffset is the offset inside the pool bo
  radeon_ib_free - free an IB (Indirect Buffer)
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ib: IB object to free
  Free an IB (all asics).
  radeon_ib_schedule - schedule an IB (Indirect Buffer) on the ring
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ib: IB object to schedule
  @const_ib: Const IB to schedule (SI only)
  @hdp_flush: Whether or not to perform an HDP cache flush
  Schedule an IB on the associated ring (all asics).
  Returns 0 on success, error on failure.
  On SI, there are two parallel engines fed from the primary ring,
  the CE (Constant Engine) and the DE (Drawing Engine).  Since
  resource descriptors have moved to memory, the CE allows you to
  prime the caches while the DE is updating register state so that
  the resource descriptors will be already in cache when the draw is
  processed.  To accomplish this, the userspace driver submits two
  IBs, one for the CE and one for the DE.  If there is a CE IB (called
  a CONST_IB), it will be put on the ring prior to the DE IB.  Prior
  to SI there was just a DE IB.
 TODO: Nothings in the ib we should report. 
 64 dwords should be enough for fence too 
 grab a vm id if necessary 
 sync with other rings 
  radeon_ib_pool_init - Init the IB (Indirect Buffer) pool
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  Initialize the suballocator to manage a pool of memory
  for use as IBs (all asics).
  Returns 0 on success, error on failure.
		 Before CIK, it's better to stick to cacheable GTT due
		  to the command stream checking
  radeon_ib_pool_fini - Free the IB (Indirect Buffer) pool
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  Tear down the suballocator managing the pool of memory
  for use as IBs (all asics).
  radeon_ib_ring_tests - test IBs on the rings
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  Test an IB (Indirect Buffer) on each ring.
  If the test fails, disable the ring.
  Returns 0 on success, error if the primary GFX ring
  IB test fails.
 oh, oh, that's really bad 
 still not good, but we can live with it

  radeon_driver_unload_kms - Main unload function for KMS.
  @dev: drm dev pointer
  This is the main unload function for KMS (all asics).
  It calls radeon_modeset_fini() to tear down the
  displays, and radeon_device_fini() to tear down
  the rest of the device (CP, writeback, etc.).
  Returns 0 on success.
  radeon_driver_load_kms - Main load function for KMS.
  @dev: drm dev pointer
  @flags: device flags
  This is the main load function for KMS (all asics).
  It calls radeon_device_init() to set up the non-display
  parts of the chip (asic init, CP, writeback, etc.), and
  radeon_modeset_init() to set up the display parts
  (crtcs, encoders, hotplug detect, etc.).
  Returns 0 on success, error on failure.
 update BUS flag 
	 radeon_device_init should report only fatal error
	  like memory allocation failure or iomapping failure,
	  or memory manager initialization failure, it must
	  properly initialize the GPU MC controller and permit
	  VRAM allocation
	 Again modeset_init should fail only on fatal error
	  otherwise it should provide enough functionalities
	  for shadowfb to run
	 Call ACPI methods: require modeset init
	  but failure is not fatal

  @dev: drm device pointer
  @data: request object
  @filp: drm filp
  This function is used to pass device specific parameters to the userspace
  drivers.  Examples include: pci device id, pipeline parms, tiling params,
  etc. (all asics).
  Returns 0 on success, -EINVAL on failure.
 xf86-video-ati 6.13.0 relies on this being false for evergreen 
		 The "value" here is both an input and output parameter.
		  If the input value is 1, filp requests hyper-z access.
		  If the input value is 0, filp revokes its hyper-z access.
		 
		  When returning, the value is 1 if filp owns hyper-z access,
 The same logic as Hyper-Z.

  radeon_get_vblank_counter_kms - get frame count
  @crtc: crtc to get the frame count from
  Gets the frame count on the requested crtc (all asics).
  Returns frame count on success, -EINVAL on failure.
	 The hw increments its frame counter at start of vsync, not at start
	  of vblank, as is required by DRM core vblank counter handling.
	  Cook the hw count here to make it appear to the caller as if it
	  incremented at start of vblank. We measure distance to start of
	  vblank in vpos. vpos therefore will be >= 0 between start of vblank
	  and start of vsync, so vpos >= 0 means to bump the hw frame counter
	  result by 1 to give the proper appearance to caller.
		 Repeat readout if needed to provide stable result if
		  we cross start of vsync during the queries.
			 Ask radeon_get_crtc_scanoutpos to return vpos as
			  distance to start of vblank, instead of regular
			  vertical scanout pos.
			 Bump counter if we are at >= leading edge of vblank,
			  but before vsync where vpos would turn negative and
			  the hw counter really increments.
 Fallback to use value as is.

	  Note: It's a threshold, not a limit. The threshold must be crossed
	  for buffer relocations to stop, so any buffer of an arbitrary size
	  can be moved as long as the threshold isn't crossed before
	  the relocation takes place. We don't want to disable buffer
	  relocations completely.
	 
	  The idea is that buffers should be placed in VRAM at creation time
	  and TTM should only do a minimum number of relocations during
	  command submission. In practice, you need to submit at least
	  a dozen IBs to move all buffers to VRAM if they are in GTT.
	 
	  Also, things can get pretty crazy under memory pressure and actual
	  VRAM usage can change a lot, so playing safe even at 50% does
	  consistently increase performance.
			 Check if this buffer will be moved and don't move it
			  if we have moved too many buffers for this IB already.
			 
			  Note that this allows moving at least one buffer of
			  any size, because it doesn't take the current "bo"
			  into account. We don't want to disallow buffer moves
			  completely.

		  DCE4: PPLL or ext clock
		  DCE5: PPLL, DCPLL, or ext clock
		  DCE6: PPLL, PPLL0, or ext clock
		 
		  Setting ATOM_PPLL_INVALID will cause SetPixelClock to skip
		  PPLLDCPLL programming and only program the DP DTO for the
		  crtc virtual pixel clock.
 skip PPLL programming if using ext clock 
 use PPLL0 for all DP 
 use DCPLL for all DP 
 use the same PPLL for all DP monitors 
 use the same PPLL for all monitors with the same clock 
 all other cases 
 on pre-R5xx asics, the crtc to pll mapping is hardcoded 
		 some atombios (observed in some DCE2DCE3) code have a bug,
		  the matching btw pll and crtc is done through
		  PCLK_CRTC[1|2]_CNTL (0x4800x484) but atombios code use the
		  pll (1 or 2) to select which register to write. ie if using
		  pll1 it will use PCLK_CRTC1_CNTL (0x480) and if using pll2
		  it will use PCLK_CRTC2_CNTL (0x484), it then use crtc id to
		  choose which value to write. Which is reverse order from
		  register logic. So only case that works is when pllid is
		  same as crtcid or when both pll and crtc are enabled and
		  both use same clock.
		 
		  So just return crtc id as if crtc and pll were hard linked
		  together even if they aren't
 always set DCPLL

  CP.
  On CIK, gfx and compute now have independant command processors.
  GFX
  Gfx consists of a single ring and can process both gfx jobs and
  compute jobs.  The gfx CP consists of three microengines (ME):
  PFP - Pre-Fetch Parser
  ME - Micro Engine
  CE - Constant Engine
  The PFP and ME make up what is considered the Drawing Engine (DE).
  The CE is an asynchronous engine used for updating buffer desciptors
  used by the DE so that they can be loaded into cache in parallel
  while the DE is processing state update packets.
  Compute
  The compute CP consists of two microengines (ME):
  MEC1 - Compute MicroEngine 1
  MEC2 - Compute MicroEngine 2
  Each MEC supports 4 compute pipes and each pipe supports 8 queues.
  The queues are exposed to userspace and are programmed directly
  by the compute runtime.

  Interrupts
  Starting with r6xx, interrupts are handled via a ring buffer.
  Ring buffers are areas of GPU accessible memory that the GPU
  writes interrupt vectors into and the host reads vectors out of.
  There is a rptr (read pointer) that determines where the
  host is currently reading, and a wptr (write pointer)
  which determines where the GPU has written.  When the
  pointers are equal, the ring is idle.  When the GPU
  writes vectors to the ring buffer, it increments the
  wptr.  When there is an interrupt, the host then starts
  fetching commands and processing them until the pointers are
  equal again at which point it updates the rptr.
  cik_enable_interrupts - Enable the interrupt ring buffer

  to the 3D engine (ring buffer, IBs, etc.), but the
  DMA controller has it's own packet format that is
  different form the PM4 format used by the 3D engine.
  It supports copying data, writing embedded data,
  solid fills, and a number of other things.  It also
  has support for tilingdetiling of buffers.

  GART
  The GART (Graphics Aperture Remapping Table) is an aperture
  in the GPU's address space.  System pages can be mapped into
  the aperture and look like contiguous pages from the GPU's
  perspective.  A page table maps the pages in the aperture
  to the actual backing pages in system memory.
  Radeon GPUs support both an internal GART, as described above,
  and AGP.  AGP works similarly, but the GART table is configured
  and maintained by the northbridge rather than the driver.
  Radeon hw has a separate AGP aperture that is programmed to
  point to the AGP aperture provided by the northbridge and the
  requests are passed through to the northbridge aperture.
  Both AGP and internal GART can be used at the same time, however
  that is not currently supported by the driver.
  This file handles the common internal GART management.
  Common GART table functions.

  R6xx+ cards need to use the 3D engine to blit data which requires
  quite a bit of hw state setup.  Rather than pull the whole 3D driver
  (which normally generates the 3D state) into the DRM, we opt to use
  statically generated state tables.  The register state and shaders
  were hand generated to support blitting functionality.  See the 3D
  driver or documentation for descriptions of the registers and
  shader instructions.

	  On all dual CRTC GPUs this bit controls the CRTC of the primary DAC.
	  Therefore it is set in the DAC DMPS function.
	  This is different for GPU's with a single CRTC but a primary and a
	  TV DAC: here it controls the single CRTC no matter where it is
	  routed. Therefore we set it here.

 Only 27 bit offset for legacy CRTC 
		 On old GPU like RN50 with little vram pining can fails because
		  current fb is taking all space needed. So instead of unpining
		  the old buffer after pining the new one, first unpin old one
		  and then retry pining new one.
		 
		  As only master can set mode only master can pin and it is
		  unlikely the master client will race with itself especialy
		  on those old gpu with single crtc.
		 
		  We don't shutdown the display controller because new buffer
		  will end up in same spot.

			   It occurs even when all dividers are the same with their old settings.
			   In this case we really don't need to fiddle with PLL registers.
			   By doing this we can avoid the blanking problem with some panels.

 Guess line buffer size to be 8192 pixels 
	
	  Line Buffer Setup
	  There is a single line buffer shared by both display controllers.
	  R_006520_DC_LB_MEMORY_SPLIT controls how that line buffer is shared between
	  the display controllers.  The paritioning can either be done
	  manually or via one of four preset allocations specified in bits 1:0:
	   0 - line buffer is divided in half and shared between crtc
	   1 - D1 gets 34 of the line buffer, D2 gets 14
	   2 - D1 gets the whole buffer
	   3 - D1 gets 14 of the line buffer, D2 gets 34
	  Setting bit 2 of R_006520_DC_LB_MEMORY_SPLIT controls switches to manual
	  allocation mode. In manual allocation mode, D1 always starts at 0,
	  D1 end2 is specified in bits 14:4; D2 allocation follows D1.

  This function parses this and relocates the VLINE START END

  It also detects a switched off crtc and nulls out the
  wait in that case. This function is common for all ASICs that
  are R600 and newer. The parsing algorithm is the same, and only
  differs in which registers are used.

  Fences
  Fences mark an event in the GPUs pipeline and are used
  for GPUCPU synchronization.  When the fence is written,
  it is expected that all buffers associated with that fence
  are no longer in use by the associated ring on the GPU and
  that the relevant GPU caches have been flushed.  Whether
  we use a scratch register or memory location depends on the asic
  and whether writeback is enabled.
  radeon_fence_write - write a fence value
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @seq: sequence number to write
  @ring: ring index the fence is associated with
  Writes a fence value to memory or a scratch register (all asics).
  radeon_fence_read - read a fence value
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: ring index the fence is associated with
  Reads a fence value from memory or a scratch register (all asics).
  Returns the value of the fence read from memory or register.
  radeon_fence_schedule_check - schedule lockup check
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: ring index we should work with
  Queues a delayed work item to check for lockups.
	
	  Do not reset the timer here with mod_delayed_work,
	  this can livelock in an interaction with TTM delayed destroy.
  radeon_fence_emit - emit a fence on the requested ring
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @fence: radeon fence object
  @ring: ring index the fence is associated with
  Emits a fence command on the requested ring (all asics).
  Returns 0 on success, -ENOMEM on failure.
 we are protected by the ring emission mutex 
  radeon_fence_check_signaled - callback from fence_queue
  this function is called with fence_queue lock held, which is also used
  for the fence locking itself, so unlocked variants are used for
  fence_signal, and remove_wait_queue.
	
	  We cannot use radeon_fence_process here because we're already
	  in the waitqueue, in a call from wake_up_all.
  radeon_fence_activity - check for fence activity
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: ring index the fence is associated with
  Checks the current fence value and calculates the last
  signalled fence value. Returns true if activity occured
  on the ring, and the fence_queue should be waken up.
	 Note there is a scenario here for an infinite loop but it's
	  very unlikely to happen. For it to happen, the current polling
	  process need to be interrupted by another process and another
	  process needs to update the last_seq btw the atomic read and
	  xchg of the current process.
	 
	  More over for this to go in infinite loop there need to be
	  continuously new fence signaled ie radeon_fence_read needs
	  to return a different value each time for both the currently
	  polling process and the other process that xchg the last_seq
	  btw atomic read and xchg of the current process. And the
	  value the other process set as last seq must be higher than
	  the seq value we just read. Which means that current process
	  need to be interrupted after radeon_fence_read and before
	  atomic xchg.
	 
	  To be even more safe we count the number of time we loop and
	  we bail after 10 loop just accepting the fact that we might
	  have temporarly set the last_seq not to the true real last
	  seq but to an older one.
		 If we loop over we don't want to return without
		  checking if a fence is signaled as it means that the
		  seq we just read is different from the previous on.
			 We looped over too many time leave with the
			  fact that we might have set an older fence
			  seq then the current real last seq as signaled
			  by the hw.
  radeon_fence_check_lockup - check for hardware lockup
  @work: delayed work item
  Checks for fence activity and if there is none probe
  the hardware if a lockup occured.
 just reschedule the check if a reset is going on 
 good news we believe it's a lockup 
 remember that we need an reset 
  radeon_fence_process - process a fence
  @rdev: radeon_device pointer
  @ring: ring index the fence is associated with
  Checks the current fence value and wakes the fence queue
  if the sequence number has increased (all asics).
  radeon_fence_seq_signaled - check if a fence sequence number has signaled
  @rdev: radeon device pointer
  @seq: sequence number
  @ring: ring index the fence is associated with
  Check if the last signaled fence sequnce number is >= the requested
  sequence number (all asics).
  Returns true if the fence has signaled (current fence value
  is >= requested value) or false if it has not (current fence
  value is < the requested value.  Helper function for

  radeon_vram_location - try to find VRAM location
  @rdev: radeon device structure holding all necessary informations
  @mc: memory controller structure holding memory informations
  @base: base address at which to put VRAM
  Function will place try to place VRAM at base address provided
  as parameter (which is so far either PCI aperture address or
  for IGP TOM base address).
  If there is not enough space to fit the unvisible VRAM in the 32bits
  address space then we limit the VRAM size to the aperture.
  If we are using AGP and if the AGP aperture doesn't allow us to have
  room for all the VRAM than we restrict the VRAM to the PCI aperture
  size and print a warning.
  This function will never fails, worst case are limiting VRAM.
  Note: GTT start, end, size should be initialized before calling this
  function on AGP platform.
  Note 1: We don't explicitly enforce VRAM start to be aligned on VRAM size,
  this shouldn't be a problem as we are using the PCI aperture as a reference.
  Otherwise this would be needed for rv280, all r3xx, and all r4xx, but
  not IGP.
  Note 2: we use mc_vram_size as on some board we need to program the mc to
  cover the whole aperture even if VRAM size is inferior to aperture size
  Novell bug 204882 + along with lots of ubuntu ones
  Note 3: when limiting vram it's safe to overwritte real_vram_size because
  we are not in case where real_vram_size is inferior to mc_vram_size (ie
  note afected by bogus hw of Novell bug 204882 + along with lots of ubuntu
  ones)
  Note 4: IGP TOM addr should be the same as the aperture addr, we don't
  explicitly check for that thought.
  FIXME: when reducing VRAM size align new size on power of 2.
  radeon_gtt_location - try to find GTT location
  @rdev: radeon device structure holding all necessary informations
  @mc: memory controller structure holding memory informations
  Function will place try to place GTT before or after VRAM.
  If GTT size is bigger than space left then we ajust GTT size.
  Thus function will never fails.

  A note about interlacing.  Let's consider HDMI 1920x1080i.
  The timing parameters we have from X are:
   Hact HsyA HsyI Htot  Vact VsyA VsyI Vtot
   1920 2448 2492 2640  1080 1084 1094 1125
  Which get translated to:
   Hact HsyA HsyI Htot  Vact VsyA VsyI Vtot
   1920 2448 2492 2640   540  542  547  562
  This is how it is defined by CEA-861-D - line and pixel numbers are
  referenced to the rising edge of VSYNC and HSYNC.  Total clocks per
  line: 2640.  The odd frame, the first active line is at line 21, and
  the even frame, the first active line is 584.
  LN:    560     561     562     563             567     568    569
  DE:    ~~~|______________________________________________________
  HSYNC: ____|~|_____|~|_____|~|_____|~|___|~|_____|~|_____|~|_____
  VSYNC: _________________________|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|__________
   22 blanking lines.  VSYNC at 1320 (referenced to the HSYNC rising edge).
  LN:    1123   1124    1125      1               5       6      7
  DE:    ~~~|______________________________________________________
  HSYNC: ____|~|_____|~|_____|~|_____|~|___|~|_____|~|_____|~|_____
  VSYNC: ____________________|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|_______________
   23 blanking lines
  The Armada LCD Controller line and pixel numbers are, like X timings,
  referenced to the top left of the active frame.
  So, translating these to our LCD controller:
   Odd frame, 563 total lines, VSYNC at line 543-548, pixel 1128.
   Even frame, 562 total lines, VSYNC at line 542-547, pixel 2448.
  Note: Vsync front porch remains constant!
  if (odd_frame) {
    vtotal = mode->crtc_vtotal + 1;
    vbackporch = mode->crtc_vsync_start - mode->crtc_vdisplay + 1;
    vhorizpos = mode->crtc_hsync_start - mode->crtc_htotal  2
  } else {
    vtotal = mode->crtc_vtotal;
    vbackporch = mode->crtc_vsync_start - mode->crtc_vdisplay;
    vhorizpos = mode->crtc_hsync_start;
  }
  vfrontporch = mode->crtc_vtotal - mode->crtc_vsync_end;
  So, we need to reprogram these registers on each vsync event:
   LCD_SPU_V_PORCH, LCD_SPU_ADV_REG, LCD_SPUT_V_H_TOTAL
  Note: we do not use the frame done interrupts because these appear
  to happen too early, and lead to jitter on the display (presumably
  they occur at the end of the last active line, before the vsync back
  porch, which we're reprogramming.)
	
	  When the dumb interface isn't in DUMB24_RGB888_0 mode, it might
	  be using SPI or GPIO.  If we set this to DUMB_BLANK, we will
	  force LCD_D[23:0] to output blank color, overriding the GPIO or
	  SPI usage.  So leave it as-is unless in DUMB24_RGB888_0 mode.
 If we have an event, we need vblank events enabled 
 We can't do interlaced modes if we don't have the SPU_ADV_REG 
 The mode_config.mutex will be held for this call 
	
	  Set CRTC modesetting parameters for the adjusted mode.  This is
	  applied after the connectors, bridges, and encoders have fixed up
	  this mode, as described above drm_atomic_helper_check_modeset().
	
	  Validate the adjusted mode in case an encoderbridge has set
	  something we don't support.
 Check whether the display mode is possible 
 These are locked by dev->vbl_lock 
	
	  Reading the ISR appears to clear bits provided CLEAN_SPU_IRQ_ISR
	  is set.  Writing has some other effect to acknowledge the IRQ -
	  without this, we only get a single IRQ.
 Mask out those interrupts we haven't enabled 
 The mode_config.mutex will be held for this call 
 Now compute the divider for real 
 Even interlacedprogressive frame 
 Odd interlaced frame 
	
	  The documentation doesn't indicate what the normal state of
	  the sync signals are.  Sebastian Hesselbart kindly probed
	  these signals on his board to determine their state.
	 
	  The non-inverted state of the sync signals is active high.
	  Setting these bits makes the appropriate signal active low.
	
	  If we aren't doing a full modeset, then we need to queue
	  the event here.
		
		  This modeset will be leaving the CRTC disabled, so
		  call the backend to disable upstream clocks etc.
		
		  We will not receive any further vblank events.
		  Send the flip_done event manually.
		
		  This modeset is enabling the CRTC after it having
		  been disabled.  Reverse the call to ->disable in
		  the atomic_disable().
			
			  In "ARGB888" (HWC32) mode, writing to the SRAM
			  requires these bits to contain:
			  31:24 = alpha 23:16 = blue 15:8 = green 7:0 = red
			  So, it's actually ABGR8888.  This is independent
			  of the SWAPRB bits in DMA control register 0.

	  We could grab something from CMA if it's enabled, but that
	  involves building in a problem:
	 
	  CMA's interface uses dma_alloc_coherent(), which provides us
	  with an CPU virtual address and a device address.
	 
	  The CPU virtual address may be either an address in the kernel
	  direct mapped region (for example, as it would be on x86) or
	  it may be remapped into another part of kernel memory space
	  (eg, as it would be on ARM.)  This means virt_to_phys() on the
	  returned virtual address is invalid depending on the architecture
	  implementation.
	 
	  The device address may also not be a physical address; it may
	  be that there is some kind of remapping between the device and
	  system RAM, which makes the use of the device address also
	  unsafe to re-use as a physical address.
	 
	  This makes DRM usage of dma_alloc_coherent() in a generic way
	  at best very questionable and unsafe.
 Otherwise, grab it from our linear allocation

	  Due to a bug in the initial host implementation of hot-plug irqs,
	  the hot-plug and cursor capability flags were never cleared.
	  Fortunately we can tell when they would have been set by checking
	  that the VSYNC flag is not set.
  Check that the position hints provided by the host are suitable for GNOME
  shell (i.e. all screens disjoint and hints for all enabled screens) and if
  not replace them with default ones.  Providing valid hints improves the
  chances that we will get a known screen layout for pointer mapping.
 Query the host for the most recent video mode hints.

  Set a graphics mode.  Poke any required values into registers, do an HGSMI
  mode set and tell the host we support advanced graphics functions.
	
	  This is the old way of setting graphics modes.  It assumed one screen
	  and a frame-buffer at the start of video RAM.  On older versions of
	  VirtualBox, certain parts of the code still assume that the first
	  screen is programmed this way, so try to fake it.
	
	  Tell the host about the view.  This design originally targeted the
	  Windows XP driver architecture and assumed that each screen would
	  have a dedicated frame buffer with the command buffer following it,
	  the whole being a "view".  The host works out which screen a command
	  buffer belongs to by checking whether it is in the first view, then
	  whether it is in the second and so on.  The first match wins.  We
	  cheat around this by making the first view be the managed memory
	  plus the first command buffer, the second the same plus the second
	  buffer and so on.
  Try to map the layout of virtual screens to the range of the input device.
  Return true if we need to re-set the crtc modes due to screen offset
  changes.
	
	  Are we using an X.Org-style single large frame-buffer for all crtcs?
	  If so then screen layout can be deduced from the crtc offsets.
	  Same fall-back if this is the fbdev frame-buffer.
 Otherwise calculate the total span of all screens. 
 vbox_do_modeset() checks vbox->single_framebuffer so update it now 
 .gamma_set = vbox_crtc_gamma_set, 
 Send information about dirty rectangles to VBVA. 
 vbox_do_modeset checks plane->state->fb and will disable if NULL 
  Copy the ARGB image and generate the mask, which is needed in case the host
  does not support ARGB cursors.  The mask is a 1BPP bitmap with the bit set
  if the corresponding alpha value in the ARGB image is greater than 0xF0.
 TODO: Use mapping abstraction properly 
	
	  VirtualBox uses the host windowing system to draw the cursor so
	  moves are a no-op, we only need to upload new cursor sprites.
	
	  The mask must be calculated based on the alpha
	  channel, one bit per ARGB word, and must be 32-bit
	  padded.

 this links to base address of new cmdlist 
 check if userptr already exists in userptr_list. 
			
			  also check size because there could be same address
			  and different size.
			
			  at this moment, maybe g2d dma is accessing this
			  g2d_userptr memory region so just remove this
			  g2d_userptr object from userptr_list not to be
			  referred again and also except it the userptr
			  pool to be released after the dma access completion.
	
	  check source and destination buffers only.
	  so the others are always valid.
 This check also makes sure that right_x > left_x. 
 This check also makes sure that bottom_y > top_y. 
 Compute the position of the last byte that the engine accesses. 
	
	  Since right_x > left_x and bottom_y > top_y we already know
	  that the first_pos < last_pos (first_pos being the position
	  of the first byte the engine accesses), it just remains to
	  check if last_pos is smaller then the buffer size.
	
	  commands in run_cmdlist have been completed so unmap all gem
	  objects in each command node so that they are unreferenced.
  g2d_remove_runqueue_nodes - remove items from the list of runqueue nodes
  @g2d: G2D state object
  @file: if not zero, only remove items with this DRM file
  Has to be called under runqueue lock.
	
	  The engine is busy and the completion of the current node is going

  g2d_wait_finish - wait for the G2D engine to finish the current runqueue node
  @g2d: G2D state object
  @file: if not zero, only wait if the current runqueue node belongs
         to the DRM file
  Should the engine not become idle after a 100ms timeout, a hardware
  reset is issued.
 If no node is currently processed, we have nothing to do. 
 Check if the currently processed item belongs to us. 
 Wait for the G2D engine to finish. 
	
	  After the hardware reset of the engine we are going to loose
	  the IRQ which triggers the PM runtime put().
	  So do this manually here.
 check userptr buffer type. 
 ioctl functions 
	
	  To avoid an integer overflow for the later size computations, we
	  enforce a maximum number of submitted commands here. This limit is
	  sufficient for all conceivable usage cases of the G2D.
	
	  If don't clear SFR registers, the cmdlist is affected by register
	  values of previous cmdlist. G2D hw executes SFR clear command and
	  a next command at the same time then the next command is ignored and
	  is executed rightly from next next command, so needs a dummy command
	  to next command of SFR clear command.
	
	  'LIST_HOLD' command should be set to the DMA_HOLD_CMD_REG
	  and GCF bit should be set to INTEN register if user wants
	  G2D interrupt event once current command list execution is
	  finished.
	  Otherwise only ACF bit should be set to INTEN register so
	  that one interrupt is occurred after all command lists
	  have been completed.
	
	  Check the size of cmdlist. The 2 that is added last comes from
	  the implicit G2D_BITBLT_START that is appended once we have
	  checked all the submitted commands.

 Let the runqueue know that there is work to do. 
 Remove the runqueue nodes that belong to us. 
	
	  Wait for the runqueue worker to finish its current node.
	  After this the engine should no longer be accessing any
	  memory belonging to us.
	
	  Even after the engine is idle, there might still be stale cmdlists
	  (i.e. cmdlisst which we submitted but never executed) around, with
	  their corresponding GEMuserptr buffers.
	  Properly unmap these buffers here.
 release all g2d_userptr in pool. 
 allocate dma-aware cmdlist buffer. 
 Suspend operation and wait for engine idle.

	  This will move the obj out of still_in_list to
	  the purged list
		
		  If it is in the process of being freed, msm_gem_free_object

		  Now that we own a reference, we can drop mm_lock for the

		  Note that this still needs to be trylock, since we can
		  hit shrinker in response to trying to get backing pages
		  for this obj (ie. while it's lock is already held)
 since we don't know any better, lets bail after a few

 For debugging crashes, userspace can:
    tail -f syskerneldebugdri<minor>rd > logfile.rd
  to log the cmdstream in a format that is understood by freedrenocffdump
  utility.  By comparing the last successfully completed fence #, to the
  cmdstream for the next fence, you can narrow down which process and submit
  caused the gpu crashlockup.
  Additionally:
    tail -f syskerneldebugdri<minor>hangrd > logfile.rd
  will capture just the cmdstream from submits which triggered a GPU hang.
  This bypasses drm_debugfs_create_files() mainly because we need to use
  our own fops for a bit more control.  In particular, we don't want to
  do anything if userspace doesn't have the debugfs file open.
  The module-param "rd_full", which defaults to false, enables snapshotting
  all (non-written) buffers in the submit, rather than just cmdstream bo's.
  This is useful to capture the contents of (for example) vbo's or textures,
  or shader programs (if not emitted inline in cmdstream).

 a2xx comes with its own MMU 
	 In the device-tree world, we could have a 'memory-region'
	  phandle, which gives us a link to our "vram".  Allocating
	  is all nicely abstracted behind the dma api, but we need
	  to know the entire size to allocate it all in one go. There
	  are two cases:
	   1) device with no IOMMU, in which case we need exclusive
	      access to a VRAM carveout big enough for all gpu
	      buffers
	   2) device with IOMMU, but where the bootloader puts up
	      a splash screen.  In this case, the VRAM carveout
	      need only be large enough for fbdev fb.  But we need
	      exclusive access to the buffer to avoid the kernel
	      using those pages for other purposes (which appears
	      as corruption on screen before we have a chance to
	      load and do initial modeset)
		 if we have no IOMMU, then we need to use carveout allocator.
		  Grab the entire CMA chunk carved out in early startup in
		  mach-msm:
		 note that for no-kernel-mapping, the vaddr returned
		  is bogus, but non-null if allocation succeeded:
 Teach lockdep about lock ordering wrt. shrinker:

  DRM ioctls:

	  be more clever to dispatch to appropriate gpu module:
	
	  Don't pin the memory here - just get an address so that userspace can
	  be productive
 value returned as immediate, not pointer, so len==0: 
 length check should leave room for terminating null: 
	
	  Map submitqueue scoped "seqno" (which is actually an idr key)
	  back to underlying dma-fence
	 
	  The fence is removed from the fence_idr when the submit is
	  retired, so if the fence is not found it means there is nothing
	  to wait for
  Componentized driver support:
  NOTE: duplication of the same code as exynos or imx (or probably any other).
  so probably some room for some helpers
  Identify what components need to be added by parsing what remote-endpoints
  our MDP output ports are connected to. In the case of LVDS on MDP4, there
  is no external component that we need to add since LVDS is within MDP4
  itself.
	
	  on MDP4 based platforms, the MDP platform device is the component
	  master that adds other display interface components to itself.
	 
	  on MDP5 based platforms, the MDSS platform device is the component
	  master that adds MDP5 and other display interface components to
	  itself.
		
		  The LCDCLVDS port on MDP4 is a speacial case where the
		  remote-endpoint isn't a component that we need to add
		
		  It's okay if some of the ports don't have a remote endpoint
		  specified. It just means that the port isn't connected to
		  any external interface.
	
	  MDP5DPU based devices don't have a flat hierarchy. There is a top
	  level parent: MDSS, and children: MDP5DPU, DSI, HDMI, eDP etc.
	  Populate the children devices, find the MDP5DPU node, and then add
	  the interfaces to our components list.
 add the MDP component itself

  Cache sync.. this is a bit over-complicated, to fit dma-mapping
  API.  Really GPU cache is out of scope here (handled on cmdstream)
  and all we need to do is invalidate newly allocated pages before
  mapping to CPU as uncachedwritecombine.
  On top of this, we have the added headache, that depending on
  display generation, the display's iommu may be wired up to either
  the toplevel drm device (mdss), or to the mdp sub-node, meaning
  that here we either have dma-direct or iommu ops.
  Let this be a cautionary tail of abstraction gone wrong.

	  check vmap_count (is_vunmapable()) outside of msm_obj lock.

	  same object from within the vmap() call (while we already
	  hold msm_obj lock)
  Don't use this!  It is for the very special case of dumping

	  there could be cases where sound card can be opened even

	  driver to maintain the correct state of clocks. To protect
	  such cases check for connection status and bail out if not
	  connected.
	
	  if audio was not enabled there is no need
	  to execute the shutdown and we can bail out early.

  CTL - MDP Control Pool Manager
  Controls are shared between all display interfaces.
  They are intended to be used for data path configuration.
  The top level register programming describes the complete data path for

  programmable_fetch_get_num_lines:
 	Number of fetch lines in vertical front porch
  @timing: Pointer to the intf timing information for the requested mode
  Returns the number of fetch lines in vertical front porch at which mdp
  can start fetching the next frame.
  Number of needed prefetch lines is anything that cannot be absorbed in the
  start of frame time (back porch + vsync pulse width).
  Some panels have very large VFP, however we only need a total number of
  lines based on the chip worst case latencies.
 Fetch must be outside active lines, otherwise undefined. 
 Warn fetch needed, but not enough porch in panel config 
  programmable_fetch_config: Programs HW to prefetch lines by offsetting
 	the start of fetch into the vertical front porch for cases where the
 	vsync pulse width and vertical back porch time is insufficient
 	Gets # of lines to pre-fetch, then calculate VSYNC counter value.
 	HW layer requires VSYNC counter of first pixel of tgt VFP line.

	  only decrement the pending flush count if we've actually flushed

 Signal any waiting atomic commit thread 
 Slave encoders don't report vblank 
 protect against negative 
	
	  For single flush cases (dual-ctl or pp-split), skip setting the
	  flush bit for the slave intf, since both intfs use same ctl
	  and HW will only flush the master.
 ctl_flush & timing engine enable will be triggered by framework 
 Wait for kickoff to complete 
	
	  hw supports hardware initiated ctl reset, so before we kickoff a new
	  frame, need to check and wait for hw initiated ctl reset completion
	
	  Wait for a vsync so we know the ENABLE=0 latched before
	  the (connector) source of the vsync's gets disabled,
	  otherwise we end up in a funny state if we re-enable
	  before the disable latches, which results that some of
	  the settings changes for the new modeset (like new
	  scanout buffer) don't latch properly..
	
	  Video mode must flush CTL before enabling timing engine
	  Video encoders need to turn on their interfaces now

		    planes with lower drm_id must be left-most in a shared

		  - planes in source split must have same dest yoff and height
	
	  Normally we would iterate through encoder_mask in crtc state to find
	  attached encoders. In this case, we might be disabling vblank _after_
	  encoder_mask has been cleared.
	 
	  Instead, we "assign" a crtc to the encoder in enable and clear it in
	  disable (which is also after encoder_mask is cleared). So instead of
	  using encoder mask, we'll ask the encoder to toggle itself iff it's
	  currently assigned to our crtc.
	 
	  Note also that this function cannot be called while crtc is disabled
	  since we use drm_crtc_vblank_onoff. So we don't need to worry
	  about the assigned crtcs being inconsistent with the current state
	  (which means no need to worry about modeset locks).

  Two to anticipate panels that can do cmdvid dynamic switching
  plan is to create all possible physical encoder types, and switch between
  them at runtime
 timeout in frames waiting for frame done 
  enum dpu_enc_rc_events - events for resource control state machine
  @DPU_ENC_RC_EVENT_KICKOFF:
 	This event happens at NORMAL priority.
 	Event that signals the start of the transfer. When this event is
 	received, enable MDPDSI core clocks. Regardless of the previous
 	state, the resource should be in ON state at the end of this event.
  @DPU_ENC_RC_EVENT_FRAME_DONE:
 	This event happens at INTERRUPT level.
 	Event signals the end of the data transfer after the PP FRAME_DONE
 	event. At the end of this event, a delayed work is scheduled to go to
 	IDLE_PC state after IDLE_TIMEOUT time.
  @DPU_ENC_RC_EVENT_PRE_STOP:
 	This event happens at NORMAL priority.
 	This event, when received during the ON state, leave the RC STATE
 	in the PRE_OFF state. It should be followed by the STOP event as
 	part of encoder disable.
 	If received during IDLE or OFF states, it will do nothing.
  @DPU_ENC_RC_EVENT_STOP:
 	This event happens at NORMAL priority.
 	When this event is received, disable all the MDPDSI core clocks, and
 	disable IRQs. It should be called from the PRE_OFF or IDLE states.
 	IDLE is expected when IDLE_PC has run, and PRE_OFF did nothing.
 	PRE_OFF is expected when PRE_STOP was executed during the ON state.
 	Resource state should be in OFF at the end of the event.
  @DPU_ENC_RC_EVENT_ENTER_IDLE:
 	This event happens at NORMAL priority from a work item.
 	Event signals that there were no frame updates for IDLE_TIMEOUT time.
 	This would disable MDPDSI core clocks and change the resource state
 	to IDLE.
  enum dpu_enc_rc_states - states that the resource control maintains
  @DPU_ENC_RC_STATE_OFF: Resource is in OFF state
  @DPU_ENC_RC_STATE_PRE_OFF: Resource is transitioning to OFF state
  @DPU_ENC_RC_STATE_ON: Resource is in ON state
  @DPU_ENC_RC_STATE_MODESET: Resource is in modeset state
  @DPU_ENC_RC_STATE_IDLE: Resource is in IDLE state
  struct dpu_encoder_virt - virtual encoder. Container of one or more physical
 	encoders. Virtual encoder manages one "logical" display. Physical
 	encoders manage one intf block, tied to a specific panelsub-panel.
 	Virtual encoder defers as much as possible to the physical encoders.
 	Virtual encoder registers itself with the DRM Framework as the encoder.
  @base:		drm_encoder base class for registration with DRM

  @phys_encs:		Container of physical encoders managed.
  @cur_master:		Pointer to the current master in this mode. Optimization
 			Only valid after enable. Cleared as disable.
  @cur_slave:		As above but for the slave encoder.
  @hw_pp:		Handle to the pingpong blocks used for the display. No.
 			pingpong blocks can be different than num_phys_encs.
  @intfs_swapped:	Whether or not the phys_enc interfaces have been swapped
 			for partial update right-only cases, such as pingpong
 			split where virtual pingpong does not generate IRQs
  @crtc:		Pointer to the currently assigned crtc. Normally you
 			would use crtc->state->encoder_mask to determine the
 			link between encodercrtc. However in this case we need
 			to track crtc in the disable() hook which is called
 			_after_ encoder_mask is cleared.
  @crtc_kickoff_cb:		Callback into CRTC that will flush & start
 				all CTL paths

 According to the current drm framework sequence, take the encoder of
  DSI_1 as master encoder
	 We assume 2 dsi nodes have the same information of bonded dsi and
	  sync-mode, and only one node specifies master in case of bonded mode.
		 Register slave host first, so that slave DSI device
		  has a chance to probe, and do not block the master
		  DSI device's probe.
		  Also, do not check defer for the slave host,
		  because only master DSI device adds the panel to global
		  panel list. The panel's device is the master DSI device.
 PLL0 is to drive both 2 DSI link clocks in bonded DSI mode. 
	 In case of bonded DSI, some registers in PHY1 have been programmed
	  during PLL0 clock's set_rate. The PHY1 reset called by host1 here
	  will silently reset those PHY1 registers. Therefore we need to reset
	  and enable both PHYs before any PLL clock operation.
	 disable DSI phy
	  In bonded dsi configuration, the phy should be disabled for the
	  first controller only when the second controller is disabled.
	
	  There is only 1 panel in the global panel list for bonded DSI mode.
	  Therefore slave dsi should get the drm_panel instance from master
	  dsi.
	
	  Set split display info to kms once bonded DSI panel is connected to
	  both hosts.
	
	  In bonded DSI mode, we have one connector that can be
	  attached to the drm_panel.
 Do nothing with the host if it is slave-DSI in case of bonded DSI 
	
	  Enable before preparing the panel, disable after unpreparing, so
	  that the panel can communicate over the DSI link.
	 Always call panel functions once, because even for dual panels,
	  there is only one drm_panel instance.

	  From DSI6G(v3), addition of a 6G_HW_VERSION register at offset 0
	  makes all other registers 4-byte shifted down.

	  Check for a firmware-name property.  This is the new scheme
	  to handle firmware that may be signed with device specific
	  keys, allowing us to have a different zap fw path for different
	  devices.
	 
	  If the firmware-name property is found, we bypass the
	  adreno_request_fw() mechanism, because we don't need to handle
	  the libfirmwareqcom... vs libfirmware... case.
	 
	  If the firmware-name property is not found, for backwards
	  compatibility we fall back to the fwname from the gpulist
	  table.
 Request the MDT file from the default location: 
		
		  For new targets, we require the firmware-name property,
		  if a zap-shader is required, rather than falling back
		  to a firmware name specified in gpulist.
		 
		  Because the firmware is signed with a (potentially)
		  device specific key, having the name come from gpulist
		  was a bad idea, and is only provided for backwards
		  compatibility for older targets.
 Figure out how much memory we need 
 Allocate memory for the firmware image 
	
	  Load the rest of the MDT
	 
	  Note that we could be dealing with two different paths, since
	  with upstream linux-firmware it would be in a qcom subdir..
	  adreno_request_fw() handles this, but qcom_mdt_load() does
	  not.  But since we've already gotten through adreno_request_fw()
	  we know which of the two cases it is:
 Send the image to the secure world 
	
	  If the scm call returns -EOPNOTSUPP we assume that this target
	  doesn't needsupport the zap shader so quietly fail
 Short cut if we determine the zap shader isn't availableneeded 
 We need SCM to be able to load the firmware 
	
	  Use the aperture start or SZ_16M, whichever is greater. This will
	  ensure that we align with the allocated pagetable range while still
	  allowing room in the lower 32 bits for GMEM and whatnot
	
	  Try first to load from qcom$fwfile using a direct load (to avoid
	  a potential timeout waiting for usermode helper)
	
	  Then try the legacy location without qcom prefix
	
	  Finally fall back to request_firmware() for cases where the
	  usermode helper is needed (I think mainly android)
 Skip if the firmware has already been loaded 
 reset completed fence seqno: 
 Use this helper to read rptr, since a430 doesn't update rptr in memory 
 XXX pm-runtime??  we need the device to be off after this
 so maybe continuing to call ->pm_suspendresume() is better?
 hmm, oh well? 
 Copy the shadow to the actual register 
	
	  Mask wptr value that we calculate to fit in the HW range. This is
	  to account for the possibility that the last command fit exactly into
	  the ringbuffer and rb->next hasn't wrapped to zero yet
 ensure writes to ringbuffer have hit system memory: 
 wait for CP to drain ringbuffer: 
 TODO maybe we need to reset GPU here to recover from hang? 
 Copy at least 'wptr' dwords of the data 
 After wptr find the last non zero dword to save space 
 Some targets prefer to collect their own registers 
 Count the number of registers 
	
	  Ascii85 outputs either a 5 byte string or a 1 byte string. So we
	  account for the worst case of 5 bytes per dword plus the 1 for '\0'
 len is expected to be in bytes 
		
		  Only dump the non-zero part of the buffer - rarely will
		  any data completely fill the entire allocated size of
		  the buffer.
		
		  If we reach here, then the originally captured binary buffer
		  will be replaced with the ascii85 encoded string
	
	  If this is state collected due to iova fault, so fault related info
	 
	  TTBR0 would not be zero, so this is a good way to distinguish
 Dump common gpu status and scratch registers on any hang, to make
  the hangcheck logs more useful.  The scratch registers seem always
  safe to read when GPU has hung (unlike some other regs, depending
  on how the GPU hung), and they are useful to match up to cmdstream
  dumps when debugging hangs:
 would be nice to not have to duplicate the _show() stuff with printk(): 
 dump these out in a form that can be parsed by demsm: 
 Use ring->next to calculate free size 
 Get legacy powerlevels from qcom,gpu-pwrlevels and populate the opp table 
		
		  Skip the intentionally bogus clock value found at the bottom
		  of most legacy frequency tables
 You down with OPP? 
 Find the fastest defined rate 
 Pick a suitably safe clock speed for any target 
			
			  Return success since either the ocmem property was
			  not specified in device tree, or ocmem support is
			  not compiled into the kernel.

	  If the microcode supports the WHERE_AM_I opcode then we can use that

 wait for CP to drain ringbuffer:

	  If stalled on SMMU fault, we could trip the GPU's hang detection,

 Turn off the hangcheck timer to keep it from bothering us 
	
	  Clear all the interrupts except RBBM_AHB_ERROR - if we clear it

	  virtio_gpu uses drm_gem_shmem_get_sg_table instead of

	  Normally the drm_dev_set_unique() call is done by core DRM.
	  The following comment covers, why virtio cannot rely on it.
	 
	  Unlike the other virtual GPU drivers, virtio abstracts the
	  underlying bus type by using struct virtio_device.
	 
	  Hence the dev_is_pci() check, used in core DRM, will fail
	  and the unique returned will be the virtio_device "virtio0",
	  while a "pci:..." one is required.
	 
	  A few other ideas were considered:
	  - Extend the dev_is_pci() check [in drm_set_busid] to
	    consider virtio.
	    Seems like a bigger hack than what we have already.
	 
	  - Point drm_device::dev to the parent of the virtio_device
	    Semantic changes:
	     Using the wrong device for i2c, framebuffer_alloc and
	      prime import.
	    Visual changes:
	     Helpers such as DRM_DEV_ERROR, dev_info, drm_printer,
	      will print the wrong information.
	 
	  We could address the latter issues, by introducing
	  drm_device::bus_dev, ... which would be used solely for this.
	 
	  So for the moment keep things as-is, with a bulky comment
	  for the next person who feels like removing this
	  drm_dev_set_unique() quirk.
	
	  Gallium command stream send by virgl is native endian.
	  Because of that we only support little endian guests on
	  little endian hosts.

  Engine, FIFO control
 ================================================================
  CCE control, initialization
 Load the microcode for the CCE 
 Flush any pending commands to the CCE.  This should only be used just
  prior to a wait for idle, as it informs the engine that the command
  stream is ending.
 Wait for the CCE to go idle.
 Start the Concurrent Command Engine.
 as per the sample code 
 Reset the Concurrent Command Engine.  This will not flush any pending
  commands, so you must wait for the CCE command stream to complete
  before calling this routine.
 Stop the Concurrent Command Engine.  This will not flush any pending
  commands, so you must flush the command stream and wait for the CCE
  to go idle before calling this routine.
 Reset the engine.  This will stop the CCE if it is running.
 Taken from the sample code - do not change 
 Reset the CCE ring 
 The CCE is no longer running after an engine reset 
 Reset any pending vertex, indirect buffers 
	 The manual (p. 2) says this address is in "VM space".  This
	  means it's an offset from the start of AGP space.
 Set watermark control 
 Force read.  Why?  Because it's in the examples... 
 Turn on bus mastering 
	 GH: Simple idle check.
	 We don't support anything other than bus-mastering ring mode,
	  but the ring can be in either AGP or PCI space for the ring
	  read pointer.
	 Make sure interrupts are disabled here because the uninstall ioctl
	  may not have been called from userspace and after dev_private
	  is freed, it's too late.
 Stop the CCE.  The engine must have been idled before calling this
  routine.
	 Flush any pending CCE commands.  This ensures any outstanding
	  commands are exectuted by the engine before we turn it off.
	 If we fail to make the engine go idle, we return an error
	  code so that the DRM ioctl wrapper can try again.
	 Finally, we can turn off the CCE.  If the engine isn't idle,
	  we will get some dropped triangles as they won't be fully
	  rendered before the CCE is shut down.
 Reset the engine 
 Just reset the CCE ring.  Called as part of an X Server engine reset.
 The CCE is no longer running after an engine reset 
 ================================================================
  Freelist management
 FIXME: Optimize -- use freelist code 
				 The buffer has been processed, so it
				  can now be used.
 ================================================================
  CCE command submission
 FIXME: This is being ignored... 
	 Please don't send us buffers.
	 We'll send you buffers.

	 The compiler won't optimize away a division by a variable,
	  even if the only legal values are powers of two.  Thus, we'll
	  use a shift instead.
	 Flush the pixel cache, and mark the contents as Read Invalid.
	  This ensures no pixel data gets mixed up with the texture
	  data from the host data blit, otherwise part of the texture
	  image may be corrupted.
	 Dispatch the indirect buffer.
	 Flush the pixel cache after the blit completes.  This ensures
	  the texture data is written out to memory before rendering
	  continues.

  IOCTL functions
	 Make sure we restore the 3D state next time.
 Swapping and flipping are different operations, need different ioctls.
  They can & should be intermixed to support multiple 3d windows.
	 Wait for the 3D stream to idle before the indirect buffer
	  containing 2D acceleration commands is processed.
	 Dispatch the indirect buffer full of commands from the
	  X server.  This is insecure and is thus only available to
	  privileged clients.

	  Vblank IRQ
	 
	  The hardware is a bit tilted: the line stays high after clearing

  DOC: Faraday TV Encoder TVE200 DRM Driver
  The Faraday TV Encoder TVE200 is also known as the Gemini TV Interface
  Controller (TVC) and is found in the Gemini Chipset from Storlink
  Semiconductor (later Storm Semiconductor, later Cortina Systems)
  but also in the Grain Media GM8180 chipset. On the Gemini the module
  is connected to 8 data lines and a single clock line, comprising an
  8-bit BT.656 interface.
  This is a very basic YUV display driver. The datasheet specifies that
  it supports the ITU BT.656 standard. It requires a 27 MHz clock which is
  the hallmark of any TV encoder supporting both PAL and NTSC.
  This driver exposes a standard KMS interface for this TV encoder.
		
		  TODO: when we are using a different bridge than a panel
		  (such as a dumb VGA connector) we need to devise a different
		  method to get the connector out of the bridge.
 Clock the silicon so we can access the registers 
 This clock is for the pixels (27MHz) 
 turn off interrupts before requesting the irq

  DOC: power_dpm_state
  The power_dpm_state file is a legacy interface and is only provided for
  backwards compatibility. The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for adjusting
  certain power related parameters.  The file power_dpm_state is used for this.
  It accepts the following arguments:
  - battery
  - balanced
  - performance
  battery
  On older GPUs, the vbios provided a special power state for battery
  operation.  Selecting battery switched to this state.  This is no
  longer provided on newer GPUs so the option does nothing in that case.
  balanced
  On older GPUs, the vbios provided a special power state for balanced
  operation.  Selecting balanced switched to this state.  This is no
  longer provided on newer GPUs so the option does nothing in that case.
  performance
  On older GPUs, the vbios provided a special power state for performance
  operation.  Selecting performance switched to this state.  This is no
  longer provided on newer GPUs so the option does nothing in that case.
  DOC: power_dpm_force_performance_level
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for adjusting certain power
  related parameters.  The file power_dpm_force_performance_level is
  used for this.  It accepts the following arguments:
  - auto
  - low
  - high
  - manual
  - profile_standard
  - profile_min_sclk
  - profile_min_mclk
  - profile_peak
  auto
  When auto is selected, the driver will attempt to dynamically select
  the optimal power profile for current conditions in the driver.
  low
  When low is selected, the clocks are forced to the lowest power state.
  high
  When high is selected, the clocks are forced to the highest power state.
  manual
  When manual is selected, the user can manually adjust which power states
  are enabled for each clock domain via the sysfs pp_dpm_mclk, pp_dpm_sclk,
  and pp_dpm_pcie files and adjust the power state transition heuristics
  via the pp_power_profile_mode sysfs file.
  profile_standard
  profile_min_sclk
  profile_min_mclk
  profile_peak
  When the profiling modes are selected, clock and power gating are
  disabled and the clocks are set for different profiling cases. This
  mode is recommended for profiling specific work loads where you do
  not want clock or power gating for clock fluctuation to interfere
  with your results. profile_standard sets the clocks to a fixed clock
  level which varies from asic to asic.  profile_min_sclk forces the sclk
  to the lowest level.  profile_min_mclk forces the mclk to the lowest level.
  profile_peak sets all clocks (mclk, sclk, pcie) to the highest levels.
 profile_exit setting is valid only when current mode is in profile mode 
 only set user selected power states 
  DOC: pp_table
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for uploading new powerplay
  tables.  The file pp_table is used for this.  Reading the file
  will dump the current power play table.  Writing to the file
  will attempt to upload a new powerplay table and re-initialize
  powerplay using that new table.
  DOC: pp_od_clk_voltage
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for adjusting the clocks and voltages
  in each power level within a power state.  The pp_od_clk_voltage is used for
  this.
  Note that the actual memory controller clock rate are exposed, not
  the effective memory clock of the DRAMs. To translate it, use the
  following formula:
  Clock conversion (Mhz):
  HBM: effective_memory_clock = memory_controller_clock  1
  G5: effective_memory_clock = memory_controller_clock  1
  G6: effective_memory_clock = memory_controller_clock  2
  DRAM data rate (MTs):
  HBM: effective_memory_clock  2 = data_rate
  G5: effective_memory_clock  4 = data_rate
  G6: effective_memory_clock  8 = data_rate
  Bandwidth (MBs):
  data_rate  vram_bit_width  8 = memory_bandwidth
  Some examples:
  G5 on RX460:
  memory_controller_clock = 1750 Mhz
  effective_memory_clock = 1750 Mhz  1 = 1750 Mhz
  data rate = 1750  4 = 7000 MTs
  memory_bandwidth = 7000  128 bits  8 = 112000 MBs
  G6 on RX5700:
  memory_controller_clock = 875 Mhz
  effective_memory_clock = 875 Mhz  2 = 1750 Mhz
  data rate = 1750  8 = 14000 MTs
  memory_bandwidth = 14000  256 bits  8 = 448000 MBs
  < For Vega10 and previous ASICs >
  Reading the file will display:
  - a list of engine clock levels and voltages labeled OD_SCLK
  - a list of memory clock levels and voltages labeled OD_MCLK
  - a list of valid ranges for sclk, mclk, and voltage labeled OD_RANGE
  To manually adjust these settings, first select manual using
  power_dpm_force_performance_level. Enter a new value for each
  level by writing a string that contains "sm level clock voltage" to
  the file.  E.g., "s 1 500 820" will update sclk level 1 to be 500 MHz
  at 820 mV; "m 0 350 810" will update mclk level 0 to be 350 MHz at
  810 mV.  When you have edited all of the states as needed, write
  "c" (commit) to the file to commit your changes.  If you want to reset to the
  default power levels, write "r" (reset) to the file to reset them.
  < For Vega20 and newer ASICs >
  Reading the file will display:
  - minimum and maximum engine clock labeled OD_SCLK
  - minimum(not available for Vega20 and Navi1x) and maximum memory
    clock labeled OD_MCLK
  - three <frequency, voltage> points labeled OD_VDDC_CURVE.
    They can be used to calibrate the sclk voltage curve.
  - voltage offset(in mV) applied on target voltage calculation.
    This is available for Sienna Cichlid, Navy Flounder and Dimgrey
    Cavefish. For these ASICs, the target voltage calculation can be
    illustrated by "voltage = voltage calculated from vf curve +
    overdrive vddgfx offset"
  - a list of valid ranges for sclk, mclk, and voltage curve points
    labeled OD_RANGE
  < For APUs >
  Reading the file will display:
  - minimum and maximum engine clock labeled OD_SCLK
  - a list of valid ranges for sclk labeled OD_RANGE
  < For VanGogh >
  Reading the file will display:
  - minimum and maximum engine clock labeled OD_SCLK
  - minimum and maximum core clocks labeled OD_CCLK
  - a list of valid ranges for sclk and cclk labeled OD_RANGE
  To manually adjust these settings:
  - First select manual using power_dpm_force_performance_level
  - For clock frequency setting, enter a new value by writing a
    string that contains "sm index clock" to the file. The index
    should be 0 if to set minimum clock. And 1 if to set maximum
    clock. E.g., "s 0 500" will update minimum sclk to be 500 MHz.
    "m 1 800" will update maximum mclk to be 800Mhz. For core
    clocks on VanGogh, the string contains "p core index clock".
    E.g., "p 2 0 800" would set the minimum core clock on core
    2 to 800Mhz.
    For sclk voltage curve, enter the new values by writing a
    string that contains "vc point clock voltage" to the file. The
    points are indexed by 0, 1 and 2. E.g., "vc 0 300 600" will
    update point1 with clock set as 300Mhz and voltage as
    600mV. "vc 2 1000 1000" will update point3 with clock set
    as 1000Mhz and voltage 1000mV.
    To update the voltage offset applied for gfxclkvoltage calculation,
    enter the new value by writing a string that contains "vo offset".
    This is supported by Sienna Cichlid, Navy Flounder and Dimgrey Cavefish.
    And the offset can be a positive or negative value.
  - When you have edited all of the states as needed, write "c" (commit)
    to the file to commit your changes
  - If you want to reset to the default power levels, write "r" (reset)
    to the file to reset them
  DOC: pp_features
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for adjusting what powerplay
  features to be enabled. The file pp_features is used for this. And
  this is only available for Vega10 and later dGPUs.
  Reading back the file will show you the followings:
  - Current ppfeature masks
  - List of the all supported powerplay features with their naming,
    bitmasks and enablement status('Y''N' means "enabled""disabled").
  To manually enable or disable a specific feature, just set or clear
  the corresponding bit from original ppfeature masks and input the
  new ppfeature masks.
  DOC: pp_dpm_sclk pp_dpm_mclk pp_dpm_socclk pp_dpm_fclk pp_dpm_dcefclk pp_dpm_pcie
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for adjusting what power levels
  are enabled for a given power state.  The files pp_dpm_sclk, pp_dpm_mclk,
  pp_dpm_socclk, pp_dpm_fclk, pp_dpm_dcefclk and pp_dpm_pcie are used for
  this.
  pp_dpm_socclk and pp_dpm_dcefclk interfaces are only available for
  Vega10 and later ASICs.
  pp_dpm_fclk interface is only available for Vega20 and later ASICs.
  Reading back the files will show you the available power levels within
  the power state and the clock information for those levels.
  To manually adjust these states, first select manual using
  power_dpm_force_performance_level.
  Secondly, enter a new value for each level by inputing a string that
  contains " echo xx xx xx > pp_dpm_sclkmclkpcie"
  E.g.,
  .. code-block:: bash
 	echo "4 5 6" > pp_dpm_sclk
  will enable sclk levels 4, 5, and 6.
  NOTE: change to the dcefclk max dpm level is not supported now
  Worst case: 32 bits individually specified, in octal at 12 characters
  per line (+1 for \n).
  DOC: pp_power_profile_mode
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for adjusting the heuristics
  related to switching between power levels in a power state.  The file
  pp_power_profile_mode is used for this.
  Reading this file outputs a list of all of the predefined power profiles
  and the relevant heuristics settings for that profile.
  To select a profile or create a custom profile, first select manual using
  power_dpm_force_performance_level.  Writing the number of a predefined
  profile to pp_power_profile_mode will enable those heuristics.  To
  create a custom set of heuristics, write a string of numbers to the file
  starting with the number of the custom profile along with a setting
  for each heuristic parameter.  Due to differences across asic families
  the heuristic parameters vary from family to family.
  DOC: gpu_busy_percent
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for reading how busy the GPU
  is as a percentage.  The file gpu_busy_percent is used for this.
  The SMU firmware computes a percentage of load based on the
  aggregate activity level in the IP cores.
 read the IP busy sensor 
  DOC: mem_busy_percent
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for reading how busy the VRAM
  is as a percentage.  The file mem_busy_percent is used for this.
  The SMU firmware computes a percentage of load based on the
  aggregate activity level in the IP cores.
 read the IP busy sensor 
  DOC: pcie_bw
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for estimating how much data
  has been received and sent by the GPU in the last second through PCIe.
  The file pcie_bw is used for this.
  The Perf counters count the number of received and sent messages and return
  those values, as well as the maximum payload size of a PCIe packet (mps).
  Note that it is not possible to easily and quickly obtain the size of each
  packet transmitted, so we output the max payload size (mps) to allow for
  quick estimation of the PCIe bandwidth usage
  DOC: unique_id
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for providing a unique ID for the GPU
  The file unique_id is used for this.
  This will provide a Unique ID that will persist from machine to machine
  NOTE: This will only work for GFX9 and newer. This file will be absent
  on unsupported ASICs (GFX8 and older)
  DOC: thermal_throttling_logging
  Thermal throttling pulls down the clock frequency and thus the performance.
  It's an useful mechanism to protect the chip from overheating. Since it
  impacts performance, the user controls whether it is enabled and if so,
  the log frequency.
  Reading back the file shows you the status(enabled or disabled) and
  the interval(in seconds) between each thermal logging.
  Writing an integer to the file, sets a new logging interval, in seconds.
  The value should be between 1 and 3600. If the value is less than 1,
  thermal logging is disabled. Values greater than 3600 are ignored.

  DOC: gpu_metrics
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for retrieving current gpu
  metrics data. The file gpu_metrics is used for this. Reading the
  file will dump all the current gpu metrics data.
  These data include temperature, frequency, engines utilization,
  power consume, throttler status, fan speed and cpu core statistics(
  available for APU only). That's it will give a snapshot of all sensors
  at the same time.
  DOC: smartshift_apu_power
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for reporting APU power
  share if it supports smartshift. The value is expressed as
  the proportion of stapm limit where stapm limit is the total APU
  power limit. The result is in percentage. If APU power is 130% of
  STAPM, then APU is using 30% of the dGPU's headroom.
  DOC: smartshift_dgpu_power
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for reporting the dGPU power
  share if the device is in HG and supports smartshift. The value
  is expressed as the proportion of stapm limit where stapm limit
  is the total APU power limit. The value is in percentage. If dGPU
  power is 20% higher than STAPM power(120%), it's using 20% of the
  APU's power headroom.
  DOC: smartshift_bias
  The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for reporting the
  smartshift(SS2.0) bias level. The value ranges from -100 to 100
  and the default is 0. -100 sets maximum preference to APU
  and 100 sets max perference to dGPU.

  DOC: hwmon
  The amdgpu driver exposes the following sensor interfaces:
  - GPU temperature (via the on-die sensor)
  - GPU voltage
  - Northbridge voltage (APUs only)
  - GPU power
  - GPU fan
  - GPU gfxcompute engine clock
  - GPU memory clock (dGPU only)
  hwmon interfaces for GPU temperature:
  - temp[1-3]_input: the on die GPU temperature in millidegrees Celsius
    - temp2_input and temp3_input are supported on SOC15 dGPUs only
  - temp[1-3]_label: temperature channel label
    - temp2_label and temp3_label are supported on SOC15 dGPUs only
  - temp[1-3]_crit: temperature critical max value in millidegrees Celsius
    - temp2_crit and temp3_crit are supported on SOC15 dGPUs only
  - temp[1-3]_crit_hyst: temperature hysteresis for critical limit in millidegrees Celsius
    - temp2_crit_hyst and temp3_crit_hyst are supported on SOC15 dGPUs only
  - temp[1-3]_emergency: temperature emergency max value(asic shutdown) in millidegrees Celsius
    - these are supported on SOC15 dGPUs only
  hwmon interfaces for GPU voltage:
  - in0_input: the voltage on the GPU in millivolts
  - in1_input: the voltage on the Northbridge in millivolts
  hwmon interfaces for GPU power:
  - power1_average: average power used by the GPU in microWatts
  - power1_cap_min: minimum cap supported in microWatts
  - power1_cap_max: maximum cap supported in microWatts
  - power1_cap: selected power cap in microWatts
  hwmon interfaces for GPU fan:
  - pwm1: pulse width modulation fan level (0-255)
  - pwm1_enable: pulse width modulation fan control method (0: no fan speed control, 1: manual fan speed control using pwm interface, 2: automatic fan speed control)
  - pwm1_min: pulse width modulation fan control minimum level (0)
  - pwm1_max: pulse width modulation fan control maximum level (255)
  - fan1_min: a minimum value Unit: revolutionmin (RPM)
  - fan1_max: a maximum value Unit: revolutionmax (RPM)
  - fan1_input: fan speed in RPM
  - fan[1-\]_target: Desired fan speed Unit: revolutionmin (RPM)
  - fan[1-\]_enable: Enable or disable the sensors.1: Enable 0: Disable
  NOTE: DO NOT set the fan speed via "pwm1" and "fan[1-\]_target" interfaces at the same time.
        That will get the former one overridden.
  hwmon interfaces for GPU clocks:
  - freq1_input: the gfxcompute clock in hertz
  - freq2_input: the memory clock in hertz
  You can use hwmon tools like sensors to view this information on your system.

convert register values from driver to SMC format 
	 Since only the initial state is completely set up at this
	 point (the other states are just copies of the boot state) we only
	 need to populate the  ARB settings for the initial state.
	
	 Cail reads current link status and reports it as cap (we cannot
	 change this due to some previous issues we had)
	 SMC drops the link status to lowest level after enabling
	 DPM by PowerPlay. After pnp or toggling CF, driver gets reloaded again
	 but this time Cail reads current link status which was set to low by
	 SMC and reports it as cap to powerplay
	 To avoid it, we set PCIeBootLinkLevel to highest dpm level
 if required, combine VRHotPCC with thermal out GPIO
 Upload all dpm data to SMC memory.(dpm level, dpm level count etc)

 If the fantable setup has failed we could have disabled
  PHM_PlatformCaps_MicrocodeFanControl even after
  this function was included in the table.
  Make sure that we still think controlling the fan is OK.
 We should restrict performance levels to low before we halt the SMC.
  On the other hand we are still in boot state when we do this
  so it would be pointless.
  If this assumption changes we have to revisit this table.

 If the fantable setup has failed we could have disabled
  PHM_PlatformCaps_MicrocodeFanControl even after
  this function was included in the table.
  Make sure that we still think controlling the fan is OK.
 We should restrict performance levels to low before we halt the SMC.
  On the other hand we are still in boot state when we do this
  so it would be pointless.
  If this assumption changes we have to revisit this table.

  DO NOT use these for errwarninfodebug messages.
  Use dev_err, dev_warn, dev_info and dev_dbg instead.
  They are more MGPU friendly.
  Although these are defined in each ASIC's specific header file.
  They share the same definitions and values. That makes common
  APIs for SMC messages issuing for all ASICs possible.
 Redefine the SMU error codes here.
  Note that these definitions are redundant and should be removed
  when the SMU has exported a unified header file containing these
  macros, which header file we can just include and use the SMU's
  macros. At the moment, these error codes are defined by the SMU
  per-ASIC unfortunately, yet we're a one driver for all ASICs.
  __smu_cmn_poll_stat -- poll for a status from the SMU
  smu: a pointer to SMU context
  Returns the status of the SMU, which could be,
     0, the SMU is busy with your previous command;
     1, execution status: success, execution result: success;
  0xFF, execution status: success, execution result: failure;
  0xFE, unknown command;
  0xFD, valid command, but bad (command) prerequisites;
  0xFC, the command was rejected as the SMU is busy;
  0xFB, "SMC_Result_DebugDataDumpEnd".
  The values here are not defined by macros, because I'd rather we
  include a single header file which defines them, which is
  maintained by the SMU FW team, so that we're impervious to firmware
  changes. At the moment those values are defined in various header
  files, one for each ASIC, yet here we're a single ASIC-agnostic
  interface. Such a change can be followed-up by a subsequent patch.
		 The SMU executed the command. It completed with a
		  successful result.
		 The SMU executed the command. It completed with an
		  unsuccessful result.
		 The SMU is busy--still executing your command.
		 Command completed successfully, but the command
		  status was failure.
		 Unknown command--ignored by the SMU.
		 Valid command--bad prerequisites.
		 The SMU is busy with other commands. The client
		  should retry in 10 us.
		 Unknown or debug response from the SMU.
  smu_cmn_send_msg_without_waiting -- send the message; don't wait for status
  @smu: pointer to an SMU context
  @msg_index: message index
  @param: message parameter to send to the SMU
  Send a message to the SMU with the parameter passed. Do not wait
  for statusresult of the message, thus the "without_waiting".
  Return 0 on success, -errno on error if we weren't able to _send_
  the message for some reason. See __smu_cmn_reg2errno() for details
  of the -errno.
  smu_cmn_wait_for_response -- wait for response from the SMU
  @smu: pointer to an SMU context
  Wait for status from the SMU.
  Return 0 on success, -errno on error, indicating the execution
  status and result of the message being waited for. See
  __smu_cmn_reg2errno() for details of the -errno.
  smu_cmn_send_smc_msg_with_param -- send a message with parameter
  @smu: pointer to an SMU context
  @msg: message to send
  @param: parameter to send to the SMU
  @read_arg: pointer to u32 to return a value from the SMU back
             to the caller
  Send the message @msg with parameter @param to the SMU, wait for
  completion of the command, and return back a value from the SMU in
  @read_arg pointer.
  Return 0 on success, -errno on error, if we weren't able to send
  the message or if the message completed with some kind of
  error. See __smu_cmn_reg2errno() for details of the -errno.
  If we weren't able to send the message to the SMU, we also print
  the error to the standard log.
  Command completion status is printed only if the -errno is
  -EREMOTEIO, indicating that the SMU returned back an
  undefinedunknownunspecified result. All other cases are
  well-defined, not printed, but instead given back to the client to
  decide what further to do.
  The return value, @read_arg is read back regardless, to give back
  more information to the client, which on error would most likely be
  @param, but we can't assume that. This also eliminates more
  conditionals.
  smu_cmn_disable_all_features_with_exception - disable all dpm features
                                                except this specified by
                                                @mask
  @smu:               smu_context pointer
  @no_hw_disablement: whether real dpm disablement should be performed
                      true: update the cache(about dpm enablement state) only
                      false: real dpm disablement plus cache update
  @mask:              the dpm feature which should not be disabled
                      SMU_FEATURE_COUNT: no exception, all dpm features
                      to disable
  Returns:
  0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
		
		  Flush hdp cache: to guard the content seen by
		  GPU is consitent with CPU.
	
	  If the ASIC comes with no audio function, we always assume
	  it is "enabled".

  smu_dpm_set_power_gate - power gateungate the specific IP block
  @handle:        smu_context pointer
  @block_type: the IP block to power gateungate
  @gate:       to power gate if true, ungate otherwise
  This API uses no smu->mutex lock protection due to:
  1. It is either called by other IP block(gfxsdmavcnuvdvce).
     This is guarded to be race condition free by the caller.
  2. Or get called on user setting request of power_dpm_force_performance_level.
     Under this case, the smu->mutex lock protection is already enforced on
     the parent API smu_force_performance_level of the call path.

	  This aims the case below:
	    amdgpu driver loaded -> runpm suspend kicked -> sound driver loaded
	 
	  For NAVI10 and later ASICs, we rely on PMFW to handle the runpm. To
	  make that possible, PMFW needs to acknowledge the dstate transition
	  process for both gfx(function 0) and audio(function 1) function of
	  the ASIC.
	 
	  The PCI device's initial runpm status is RUNPM_SUSPENDED. So as the
	  device representing the audio function of the ASIC. And that means
	  even if the sound driver(snd_hda_intel) was not loaded yet, it's still
	  possible runpm suspend kicked on the ASIC. However without the dstate
	  transition notification from audio function, pmfw cannot handle the
	  BACO inexit correctly. And that will cause driver hang on runpm
	  resuming.
	 
	  To address this, we revert to legacy message way(driver masters the
	  timing for BACO inexit) on sound driver missing.
 Wait for PMFW handling for the Dstate change 
	
	  For S3S4Runpm resume, no need to setup those overdrive tables again as
	    - either they already have the default OD settings got during cold bootup
	    - or they have some user customized OD settings which cannot be overwritten
 Allow setting zero to disable the OverDrive VDDC curve
 If setting 0, disable all voltage curve settings
 This workaround can be applied only with uclk dpm enabled 
	
	  The NAVI10_UMC_HYBRID_CDR_WORKAROUND_UCLK_THRESHOLD is 750Mhz.
	  This workaround is needed only when the max uclk frequency
	  not greater than that.

 Revert the UCLK Hardmax 
	
	  In this case, SMU already disabled dummy pstate during enablement

  The AMDgpu display manager, amdgpu_dm (or even simpler,
  dm) sits between DRM and DC. It acts as a liaison, converting DRM
  requests into DC requests, and DC responses into DRM responses.
  The root control structure is &struct amdgpu_display_manager.

  provided by DAL. The drm strcutures are: drm_crtc, drm_connector,

		  irq handler after start of back-porch (vline 0). We queue the
		  pageflip event for send-out by drm_crtc_handle_vblank() with
		  updated timestamp and count, once it runs after us.
		 
		  We need to open-code this instead of using the helper

 sequence will be replaced by real count during send-out. 
	 Keep track of vblank of this flip for flip throttling. We use the
	  cooked hw counter, as that one incremented at start of this vblank
	  of pageflip completion, so last_flip_vblank is the forbidden count
	  for queueing new pageflips if vsync + VRR is enabled.
		 Core vblank handling is done here after end of front-porch in
		  vrr mode, as vblank timestamping will give valid results
		  while now done after front-porch. This will also deliver
		  page-flip completion events that have been queued to us
		  if a pageflip happened inside front-porch.

  dm_crtc_high_irq() - Handles CRTC interrupt
  @interrupt_params: used for determining the CRTC instance
  Handles the CRTCVSYNC interrupt by notfying DRM's VBLANK
  event handler.
	
	  Core vblank handling at start of front-porch is only possible
	  in non-vrr mode, as only there vblank timestamping will give
	  valid results while done in front-porch. Otherwise defer it
	  to dm_vupdate_high_irq after end of front-porch.
	
	  Following stuff must happen at start of vblank, for crc
	  computation and below-the-range btr support in vrr mode.
 BTR updates need to happen before VUPDATE on Vega and above. 
	
	  If there aren't any active_planes then DCH HUBP may be clock-gated.
	  In that case, pageflip completion interrupts won't fire and pageflip
	  completion events won't get delivered. Prevent this by sending
	  pending pageflip events from here if a flip is still pending.
	 
	  If any planes are enabled, use dm_pflip_high_irq() instead, to
	  avoid race conditions between flip programming and completion,
	  which could cause too early flip completion events.

	 From the specification (CTA-861-G), for calculating the maximum
	  luminance we need to use:
	 	Luminance = 502(CV32)
	  Where CV is a one-byte value.
	  For calculating this expression we may need float point precision;
	  to avoid this complexity level, we take advantage that CV is divided
	  by a constant. From the Euclids division algorithm, we know that CV
	  can be written as: CV = 32q + r. Next, we replace CV in the
	  Luminance expression and get 50(2q)(2(r32)), hence we just
	  need to pre-compute the value of r32. For pre-computing the values
	  We just used the following Ruby line:
	 	(0...32).each {|cv| puts (502(cv32.0)).round}
	  The results of the above expressions can be verified at
	  pre_computed_values.

				  retain and release below are used to

				  reshuffle by UMD we will get into unwanted dc_sink release

  DOC: FreeSync Video
  When a userspace application wants to play a video, the content follows a
  standard format definition that usually specifies the FPS for that format.
  The below list illustrates some video format and the expected FPS,
  respectively:
  - TVNTSC (23.976 FPS)
  - Cinema (24 FPS)
  - TVPAL (25 FPS)
  - TVNTSC (29.97 FPS)
  - TVNTSC (30 FPS)
  - Cinema HFR (48 FPS)
  - TVPAL (50 FPS)
  - Commonly used (60 FPS)
  - Multiples of 24 (48,72,96,120 FPS)
  The list of standards video format is not huge and can be added to the
  connector modeset list beforehand. With that, userspace can leverage
  FreeSync to extends the front porch in order to attain the target refresh
  rate. Such a switch will happen seamlessly, without screen blanking or
  reprogramming of the output in any other way. If the userspace requests a
  modesetting change compatible with FreeSync modes that only differ in the
  refresh rate, DC will skip the full update and avoid blink during the
  transition. For example, the video player can change the modesetting from
  60Hz to 30Hz for playing TVNTSC content when it goes full screen without
  causing any display blink. This same concept can be applied to a mode
  setting change.
 Find the preferred mode 
 Probably an EDID with no preferred mode. Fallback to first entry

	  For some monitors, preferred mode is not the mode with highest

		  This may not be an error, the use case is when we have no
		  usermode calls to reset and set mode upon hotplug. In this
		  case, we call set mode ourselves to restore the previous mode
		  and the modelist may not be filled in in time.
	 If scaling is enabled and refresh rate didn't change
	 we copy the vic and polarities of the old timings

  Validate that the given atomic state is programmable by DC into hardware.
  This involves constructing a &struct dc_state reflecting the new hardware
  state we wish to commit, then querying DC to see if it is programmable. It's
  important not to modify the existing DC state. Otherwise, atomic_check
  may unexpectedly commit hardware changes.
  When validating the DC state, it's important that the right locks are
  acquired. For full updates case which removesaddsupdates streams on one
  CRTC while flipping on another CRTC, acquiring global lock will guarantee
  that any such full update commit will wait for completion of any outstanding
  flip using DRMs synchronization events.
  Note that DM adds the affected connectors for all CRTCs in state, when that
  might not seem necessary. This is because DC stream creation requires the
  DC sink, which is tied to the DRM connector state. Cleaning this up should
  be possible but non-trivial - a possible TODO item.

  If the SRM version being loaded is less than or equal to the
  currently loaded SRM, psp will return 0xFFFF as the version
			 Explicitly set the saved SRM as sysfs call will be after we already enabled hdcp
			  (s3 resume case)
	 the removal of display will invoke auth reset -> hdcp destroy and
	  we'd expect the Content Protection (CP) property changed back to
	  DESIRED if at the time ENABLED. CP property change should occur
	  before the element removed from linked list.
 NOTE: From the usermodes prospective you only need to call write ONCE, the kernel
       will automatically call once or twice depending on the size
  call: "cat file > sysclassdrmcard0devicehdcp_srm" from usermode no matter what the size is
  The kernel can only send PAGE_SIZE at once and since MAX_SRM_FILE(5120) > PAGE_SIZE(4096),
  srm_data_write can be called multiple times.
  sysfs interface doesn't tell us the size we will get so we are sending partial SRMs to psp and on
  the last call we will send the full SRM. PSP will fail on every call before the last.
  This means we don't know if the SRM is good until the last call. And because of this limitation we
  cannot throw errors early as it will stop the kernel from writing to sysfs
  Example 1:
  	Good SRM size = 5096
  	first call to write 4096 -> PSP fails
  	Second call to write 1000 -> PSP Pass -> SRM is set
  Example 2:
  	Bad SRM size = 4096
  	first call to write 4096 -> PSP fails (This is the same as above, but we don't know if this
  	is the last call)
  Solution?:
  	1: Parse the SRM? -> It is signed so we don't know the EOF
  	2: We can have another sysfs that passes the size before calling set. -> simpler solution
  	below
  Easy Solution:
  Always call get after Set to verify if set was successful.
  +----------------------+
  |   Why it works:      |
  +----------------------+
  PSP will only update its srm if its older than the one we are trying to load.
  Always do set first than get.
  	-if we try to "1. SET" a older version PSP will reject it and we can "2. GET" the newer
  	version and save it
  	-if we try to "1. SET" a newer version PSP will accept it and we can "2. GET" the
  	same(newer) version back and save it
  	-if we try to "1. SET" a newer version and PSP rejects it. That means the format is
  	incorrectcorrupted and we should correct our SRM by getting it from PSP
 From the hdcp spec (5.Renewability) SRM needs to be stored in a non-volatile memory.
  For example,
  	if Application "A" sets the SRM (ver 2) and we rebootsuspend and later when Application "B"
  	needs to use HDCP, the version in PSP should be SRM(ver 2). So SRM should be persistent
  	across bootrebootssuspendresumeshutdown
  Currently when the system goes down (suspendshutdown) the SRM is cleared from PSP. For HDCP we need
  to make the SRM persistent.
  -PSP owns the checking of SRM but doesn't have the ability to store it in a non-volatile memory.
  -The kernel cannot write to the file systems.
  -So we need usermode to do this for us, which is why an interface for usermode is needed
  Usermode can readwrite tofrom PSP using the sysfs interface
  For example:
  	to save SRM from PSP to storage : cat sysclassdrmcard0devicehdcp_srm > srmfile
  	to load from storage to PSP: cat srmfile > sysclassdrmcard0devicehdcp_srm
 Limit SRM size

	 Usage: set DP physical test pattern using debugfs with normal DP
	  panel. Then plug out DP panel and connect a scope to measure
	  For normal video mode and test pattern generated from CRCT,
	  they are visibile to user. So do not disable HPD.
	  Video Mode is also set to clear the test pattern, so enable HPD
	  because it might have been disabled after a test pattern was set.
	  AUX depends on HPD  sequence dependent, do not move!
	 Usage: Set DP physical test pattern using AMDDP with normal DP panel
	  Then plug out DP panel and connect a scope to measure DP PHY signal.

  The DC interface to HW gives us the following color management blocks
  per pipe (surface):
  - Input gamma LUT (de-normalized)
  - Input CSC (normalized)
  - Surface degamma LUT (normalized)
  - Surface CSC (normalized)
  - Surface regamma LUT (normalized)
  - Output CSC (normalized)
  But these aren't a direct mapping to DRM color properties. The current DRM
  interface exposes CRTC degamma, CRTC CTM and CRTC regamma while our hardware
  is essentially giving:
  Plane CTM -> Plane degamma -> Plane CTM -> Plane regamma -> Plane CTM
  The input gamma LUT block isn't really applicable here since it operates
  on the actual input data itself rather than the HW fp representation. The
  input and output CSC blocks are technically available to use as part of
  the DC interface but are typically used internally by DC for conversions
  between color spaces. These could be blended together with user
  adjustments in the future but for now these should remain untouched.
  The pipe blending also happens after these blocks so we don't actually
  support any CRTC props with correct blending with multiple planes - but we
  can still support CRTC color management properties in DM in most single
  plane cases correctly with clever management of the DC interface in DM.
  As per DRM documentation, blocks should be in hardware bypass when their
  respective property is set to NULL. A linear DGMRGM LUT should also
  considered as putting the respective block into bypass mode.
  This means that the following
  configuration is assumed to be the default:
  Plane DGM Bypass -> Plane CTM Bypass -> Plane RGM Bypass -> ...
  CRTC DGM Bypass -> CRTC CTM Bypass -> CRTC RGM Bypass
  Initialize the color module.
  We're not using the full color module, only certain components.
  Only call setup functions for components that we need.
 Extracts the DRM lut and lut size from a blob. 
  Return true if the given lut is a linear mapping of values, i.e. it acts
  like a bypass LUT.
  It is considered linear if the lut represents:
  f(a) = (0xFF00MAX_COLOR_LUT_ENTRIES-1)a; for integer a in
                                            [0, MAX_COLOR_LUT_ENTRIES)
 All color values should equal 
 Allow a +-1 error. 
  Convert the drm_color_lut to dc_gamma. The conversion depends on the size
  of the lut - whether or not it's legacy.
 else 
  Converts a DRM CTM to a DC CSC float matrix.
  The matrix needs to be a 3x4 (12 entry) matrix.
	
	  DRM gives a 3x3 matrix, but DC wants 3x4. Assuming we're operating
	  with homogeneous coordinates, augment the matrix with 0's.
	 
	  The format provided is S31.32, using signed-magnitude representation.
	  Our fixed31_32 is also S31.32, but is using 2's complement. We have
	  to convert from signed-magnitude to 2's complement.
 Skip 4th element 
 gamut_remap_matrix[i] = ctm[i - floor(i4)] 
 If negative, convert to 2's complement. 
 Calculates the legacy transfer function - only for sRGB input space. 
 Calculates the output transfer function based on expected input space. 
		
		  Color module doesn't like calculating regamma params
		  on top of a linear input. But degamma params can be used
		  instead to simulate this.
		
		  Assume sRGB. The actual mapping will depend on whether the
		  input was legacy or not.
 Caculates the input transfer function based on expected input space. 
  Verifies that the Degamma and Gamma LUTs attached to the |crtc_state| are of
  the expected size.
  Returns 0 on success.
  amdgpu_dm_update_crtc_color_mgmt: Maps DRM color management to DC stream.
  @crtc: amdgpu_dm crtc state
  With no plane level color management properties we're free to use any
  of the HW blocks as long as the CRTC CTM always comes before the
  CRTC RGM and after the CRTC DGM.
  The CRTC RGM block will be placed in the RGM LUT block if it is non-linear.
  The CRTC DGM block will be placed in the DGM LUT block if it is non-linear.
  The CRTC CTM will be placed in the gamut remap block if it is non-linear.
  The RGM block is typically more fully featured and accurate across
  all ASICs - DCE can't support a custom non-linear CRTC DGM.
  For supporting both plane level color management and CRTC level color
  management at once we have to either restrict the usage of CRTC properties
  or blend adjustments together.
  Returns 0 on success.
 Reset all adjustments. 
 Setup regamma and degamma. 
		
		  Legacy regamma forces us to use the sRGB RGM as a base.
		  This also means we can't use linear DGM since DGM needs
		  to use sRGB as a base as well, resulting in incorrect CRTC
		  DGM and CRTC CTM.
		 
		  TODO: Just map this to the standard regamma interface
		  instead since this isn't really right. One of the cases
		  where this setup currently fails is trying to do an
		  inverse color ramp in legacy userspace.
 CRTC RGM goes into RGM LUT. 
		
		  No CRTC RGM means we can just put the block into bypass
		  since we don't have any plane level adjustments using it.
	
	  CRTC DGM goes into DGM LUT. It would be nice to place it
	  into the RGM since it's a more featured block but we'd
	  have to place the CTM in the OCSC in that case.
 Setup CRTC CTM. 
		
		  Gamut remapping must be used for gamma correction
		  since it comes before the regamma correction.
		 
		  OCSC could be used for gamma correction, but we'd need to
		  blend the adjustments together with the required output
		  conversion matrix - so just use the gamut remap block
		  for now.
 Bypass CTM. 
  amdgpu_dm_update_plane_color_mgmt: Maps DRM color management to DC plane.
  @crtc: amdgpu_dm crtc state
  @dc_plane_state: target DC surface
  Update the underlying dc_stream_state's input transfer function (ITF) in
  preparation for hardware commit. The transfer function used depends on
  the prepartion done on the stream for color management.
  Returns 0 on success.
 Get the correct base transfer function for implicit degamma. 
 DC doesn't have a transfer function for BT601 specifically. 
		
		  This case isn't fully correct, but also fairly
		  uncommon. This is userspace trying to use a
		  legacy gamma LUT + atomic degamma LUT
		  at the same time.
		 
		  Legacy gamma requires the input to be in linear
		  space, so that means we need to apply an sRGB
		  degamma. But color module also doesn't support
		  a user ramp in this case so the degamma will
		  be lost.
		 
		  Even if we did support it, it's still not right:
		 
		  Input -> CRTC DGM -> sRGB DGM -> CRTC CTM ->
		  sRGB RGM -> CRTC RGM -> Output
		 
		  The CSC will be done in the wrong space since
		  we're applying an sRGB DGM on top of the CRTC
		  DGM.
		 
		  TODO: Don't use the legacy gamma interface and just
		  map these to the atomic one instead.
		
		  For legacy gamma support we need the regamma input
		  in linear space. Assume that the input is sRGB.
 ...Otherwise we can just bypass the DGM block.
