/* Eviction Fence

 * Fence helper functions to deal with KFD memory eviction.

 * Big Idea - Since KFD submissions are done by user queues, a BO cannot be

 *  evicted unless all the user queues for that process are evicted.

 *

 * All the BOs in a process share an eviction fence. When process X wants

 * to map VRAM memory but TTM can't find enough space, TTM will attempt to

 * evict BOs from its LRU list. TTM checks if the BO is valuable to evict

 * by calling ttm_device_funcs->eviction_valuable().

 *

 * ttm_device_funcs->eviction_valuable() - will return false if the BO belongs

 *  to process X. Otherwise, it will return true to indicate BO can be

 *  evicted by TTM.

 *

 * If ttm_device_funcs->eviction_valuable returns true, then TTM will continue

 * the evcition process for that BO by calling ttm_bo_evict --> amdgpu_bo_move

 * --> amdgpu_copy_buffer(). This sets up job in GPU scheduler.

 *

 * GPU Scheduler (amd_sched_main) - sets up a cb (fence_add_callback) to

 *  nofity when the BO is free to move. fence_add_callback --> enable_signaling

 *  --> amdgpu_amdkfd_fence.enable_signaling

 *

 * amdgpu_amdkfd_fence.enable_signaling - Start a work item that will quiesce

 * user queues and signal fence. The work item will also start another delayed

 * work item to restore BOs

 This reference gets released in amdkfd_fence_release */

 *

 * The amdgpu vkms interface provides a virtual KMS interface for several use

 * cases: devices without display hardware, platforms where the actual display

 * hardware is not useful (e.g., servers), SR-IOV virtual functions, device

 * emulation/simulation, and device bring up prior to display hardware being

 * usable. We previously emulated a legacy KMS interface, but there was a desire

 * to move to the atomic KMS interface. The vkms driver did everything we

 * needed, but we wanted KMS support natively in the driver without buffer

 * sharing and the ability to support an instance of VKMS per device. We first

 * looked at splitting vkms into a stub driver and a helper module that other

 * drivers could use to implement a virtual display, but this strategy ended up

 * being messy due to driver specific callbacks needed for buffer management.

 * Ultimately, it proved easier to import the vkms code as it mostly used core

 * drm helpers anyway.

	/*

	 * To prevent races we roll the hrtimer forward before we do any

	 * interrupt processing - this is how real hw works (the interrupt is

	 * only generated after all the vblank registers are updated) and what

/*

 * GART

 * The GART (Graphics Aperture Remapping Table) is an aperture

 * in the GPU's address space.  System pages can be mapped into

 * the aperture and look like contiguous pages from the GPU's

 * perspective.  A page table maps the pages in the aperture

 * to the actual backing pages in system memory.

 *

 * Radeon GPUs support both an internal GART, as described above,

 * and AGP.  AGP works similarly, but the GART table is configured

 * and maintained by the northbridge rather than the driver.

 * Radeon hw has a separate AGP aperture that is programmed to

 * point to the AGP aperture provided by the northbridge and the

 * requests are passed through to the northbridge aperture.

 * Both AGP and internal GART can be used at the same time, however

 * that is not currently supported by the driver.

 *

 * This file handles the common internal GART management.

 * The compute CP consists of two microengines (ME):

 * Interrupts

 * Starting with r6xx, interrupts are handled via a ring buffer.

 * Ring buffers are areas of GPU accessible memory that the GPU

 * writes interrupt vectors into and the host reads vectors out of.

 * There is a rptr (read pointer) that determines where the

 * host is currently reading, and a wptr (write pointer)

 * which determines where the GPU has written.  When the

 * pointers are equal, the ring is idle.  When the GPU

 * writes vectors to the ring buffer, it increments the

 * wptr.  When there is an interrupt, the host then starts

 * fetching commands and processing them until the pointers are

 * equal again at which point it updates the rptr.

/*

 * Interrupts

 * Starting with r6xx, interrupts are handled via a ring buffer.

 * Ring buffers are areas of GPU accessible memory that the GPU

 * writes interrupt vectors into and the host reads vectors out of.

 * There is a rptr (read pointer) that determines where the

 * host is currently reading, and a wptr (write pointer)

 * which determines where the GPU has written.  When the

 * pointers are equal, the ring is idle.  When the GPU

 * writes vectors to the ring buffer, it increments the

 * wptr.  When there is an interrupt, the host then starts

 * fetching commands and processing them until the pointers are

 * equal again at which point it updates the rptr.

 *      Rob Clark <rob.clark@linaro.org>

/** @file ttm_ref_object.c

 *

 * Base- and reference object implementation for the various

 * ttm objects. Implements reference counting, minimal security checks

 * and release on file close.

/**

 * struct ttm_object_file

 *

 * @tdev: Pointer to the ttm_object_device.

 *

 * @lock: Lock that protects the ref_list list and the

 * ref_hash hash tables.

 *

 * @ref_list: List of ttm_ref_objects to be destroyed at

 * file release.

 *

 * @ref_hash: Hash tables of ref objects, one per ttm_ref_type,

 * for fast lookup of ref objects given a base object.

 *

 * @refcount: reference/usage count

/*

 * struct ttm_object_device

 *

 * @object_lock: lock that protects the object_hash hash table.

 *

 * @object_hash: hash table for fast lookup of object global names.

 *

 * @object_count: Per device object count.

 *

 * This is the per-device data structure needed for ttm object management.

/*

 * struct ttm_ref_object

 *

 * @hash: Hash entry for the per-file object reference hash.

 *

 * @head: List entry for the per-file list of ref-objects.

 *

 * @kref: Ref count.

 *

 * @obj: Base object this ref object is referencing.

 *

 * @ref_type: Type of ref object.

 *

 * This is similar to an idr object, but it also has a hash table entry

 * that allows lookup with a pointer to the referenced object as a key. In

 * that way, one can easily detect whether a base object is referenced by

 * a particular ttm_object_file. It also carries a ref count to avoid creating

 * multiple ref objects if a ttm_object_file references the same base

 * object more than once.

	/*

	 * Note: We don't use synchronize_rcu() here because it's far

	 * too slow. It's up to the user to free the object using

	 * call_rcu() or ttm_base_object_kfree().

/**

 * ttm_base_object_noref_lookup - look up a base object without reference

 * @tfile: The struct ttm_object_file the object is registered with.

 * @key: The object handle.

 *

 * This function looks up a ttm base object and returns a pointer to it

 * without refcounting the pointer. The returned pointer is only valid

 * until ttm_base_object_noref_release() is called, and the object

 * pointed to by the returned pointer may be doomed. Any persistent usage

 * of the object requires a refcount to be taken using kref_get_unless_zero().

 * Iff this function returns successfully it needs to be paired with

 * ttm_base_object_noref_release() and no sleeping- or scheduling functions

 * may be called inbetween these function callse.

 *

 * Return: A pointer to the object if successful or NULL otherwise.

/**

 * ttm_ref_object_exists - Check whether a caller has a valid ref object

 * (has opened) a base object.

 *

 * @tfile: Pointer to a struct ttm_object_file identifying the caller.

 * @base: Pointer to a struct base object.

 *

 * Checks wether the caller identified by @tfile has put a valid USAGE

 * reference object on the base object identified by @base.

	/*

	 * Verify that the ref object is really pointing to our base object.

	 * Our base object could actually be dead, and the ref object pointing

	 * to another base object with the same handle.

	/*

	 * Verify that the ref->obj pointer was actually valid!

	/*

	 * Since we release the lock within the loop, we have to

	 * restart it from the beginning each time.

/**

 * get_dma_buf_unless_doomed - get a dma_buf reference if possible.

 *

 * @dmabuf: Non-refcounted pointer to a struct dma-buf.

 *

 * Obtain a file reference from a lookup structure that doesn't refcount

 * the file, but synchronizes with its release method to make sure it has

 * not been freed yet. See for example kref_get_unless_zero documentation.

 * Returns true if refcounting succeeds, false otherwise.

 *

 * Nobody really wants this as a public API yet, so let it mature here

 * for some time...

/**

 * ttm_prime_refcount_release - refcount release method for a prime object.

 *

 * @p_base: Pointer to ttm_base_object pointer.

 *

 * This is a wrapper that calls the refcount_release founction of the

 * underlying object. At the same time it cleans up the prime object.

 * This function is called when all references to the base object we

 * derive from are gone.

/**

 * ttm_prime_dmabuf_release - Release method for the dma-bufs we export

 *

 * @dma_buf:

 *

 * This function first calls the dma_buf release method the driver

 * provides. Then it cleans up our dma_buf pointer used for lookup,

 * and finally releases the reference the dma_buf has on our base

 * object.

/**

 * ttm_prime_fd_to_handle - Get a base object handle from a prime fd

 *

 * @tfile: A struct ttm_object_file identifying the caller.

 * @fd: The prime / dmabuf fd.

 * @handle: The returned handle.

 *

 * This function returns a handle to an object that previously exported

 * a dma-buf. Note that we don't handle imports yet, because we simply

 * have no consumers of that implementation.

/**

 * ttm_prime_handle_to_fd - Return a dma_buf fd from a ttm prime object

 *

 * @tfile: Struct ttm_object_file identifying the caller.

 * @handle: Handle to the object we're exporting from.

 * @flags: flags for dma-buf creation. We just pass them on.

 * @prime_fd: The returned file descriptor.

/*

 * This file implements the vmwgfx context binding manager,

 * The sole reason for having to use this code is that vmware guest

 * backed contexts can be swapped out to their backing mobs by the device

 * at any time, also swapped in at any time. At swapin time, the device

 * validates the context bindings to make sure they point to valid resources.

 * It's this outside-of-drawcall validation (that can happen at any time),

 * that makes this code necessary.

 *

 * We therefore need to kill any context bindings pointing to a resource

 * when the resource is swapped out. Furthermore, if the vmwgfx driver has

 * swapped out the context we can't swap it in again to kill bindings because

 * of backing mob reservation lockdep violations, so as part of

 * context swapout, also kill all bindings of a context, so that they are

 * already killed if a resource to which a binding points

 * needs to be swapped out.

 *

 * Note that a resource can be pointed to by bindings from multiple contexts,

 * Therefore we can't easily protect this data by a per context mutex

 * (unless we use deadlock-safe WW mutexes). So we use a global binding_mutex

 * to protect all binding manager data.

 *

 * Finally, any association between a context and a global resource

 * (surface, shader or even DX query) is conceptually a context binding that

 * needs to be tracked by this code.

/*

 * Note on fencing subsystem usage of irqs:

 * Typically the vmw_fences_update function is called

 *

 * a) When a new fence seqno has been submitted by the fifo code.

 * b) On-demand when we have waiters. Sleeping waiters will switch on the

 * ANY_FENCE irq and call vmw_fences_update function each time an ANY_FENCE

 * irq is received. When the last fence waiter is gone, that IRQ is masked

 * away.

 *

 * In situations where there are no waiters and we don't submit any new fences,

 * fence objects may not be signaled. This is perfectly OK, since there are

 * no consumers of the signaled data, but that is NOT ok when there are fence

 * actions attached to a fence. The fencing subsystem then makes use of the

 * FENCE_GOAL irq and sets the fence goal seqno to that of the next fence

 * which has an action attached, and each time vmw_fences_update is called,

 * the subsystem makes sure the fence goal seqno is updated.

 *

 * The fence goal seqno irq is on as long as there are unsignaled fence

 * objects with actions attached to them.

 * DOC: ARM PrimeCell PL110 and PL111 CLCD Driver

 *

 * The PL110/PL111 is a simple LCD controller that can support TFT

 * and STN displays. This driver exposes a standard KMS interface

 * for them.

 *

 * The driver currently doesn't expose the cursor.  The DRM API for

 * cursors requires support for 64x64 ARGB8888 cursor images, while

 * the hardware can only support 64x64 monochrome with masking

 * cursors.  While one could imagine trying to hack something together

 * to look at the ARGB8888 and program reasonable in monochrome, we

 * just don't expose the cursor at all instead, and leave cursor

 * support to the application software cursor layer.

 *

 * TODO:

 *

 * - Fix race between setting plane base address and getting IRQ for

 *   vsync firing the pageflip completion.

 *

 * - Read back hardware state at boot to skip reprogramming the

 *   hardware when doing a no-op modeset.

 *

 * - Use the CLKSEL bit to support switching between the two external

 *   clock parents.

				/*

				 * Something deferred, but that is often just

				 * another way of saying -ENODEV, but let's

				 * cast a vote for later deferral.

 Continue, maybe something else is working */

	/*

	 * If we can't find neither panel nor bridge on any of the

	 * endpoints, and any of them retured -EPROBE_DEFER, then

	 * let's defer this driver too.

	/*

/**

 * DOC: ST-Ericsson MCDE Driver

 *

 * The MCDE (short for multi-channel display engine) is a graphics

 * controller found in the Ux500 chipsets, such as NovaThor U8500.

 * It was initially conceptualized by ST Microelectronics for the

 * successor of the Nomadik line, STn8500 but productified in the

 * ST-Ericsson U8500 where is was used for mass-market deployments

 * in Android phones from Samsung and Sony Ericsson.

 *

 * It can do 1080p30 on SDTV CCIR656, DPI-2, DBI-2 or DSI for

 * panels with or without frame buffering and can convert most

 * input formats including most variants of RGB and YUV.

 *

 * The hardware has four display pipes, and the layout is a little

 * bit like this::

 *

 *   Memory     -> Overlay -> Channel -> FIFO -> 8 formatters -> DSI/DPI

 *   External      0..5       0..3       A,B,    6 x DSI         bridge

 *   source 0..9                         C0,C1   2 x DPI

 *

 * FIFOs A and B are for LCD and HDMI while FIFO CO/C1 are for

 * panels with embedded buffer.

 * 6 of the formatters are for DSI, 3 pairs for VID/CMD respectively.

 * 2 of the formatters are for DPI.

 *

 * Behind the formatters are the DSI or DPI ports that route to

 * the external pins of the chip. As there are 3 DSI ports and one

 * DPI port, it is possible to configure up to 4 display pipelines

 * (effectively using channels 0..3) for concurrent use.

 *

 * In the current DRM/KMS setup, we use one external source, one overlay,

 * one FIFO and one formatter which we connect to the simple CMA framebuffer

 * helpers. We then provide a bridge to the DSI port, and on the DSI port

 * bridge we connect hang a panel bridge or other bridge. This may be subject

 * to change as we exploit more of the hardware capabilities.

 *

 * TODO:

 *

 * - Enabled damaged rectangles using drm_plane_enable_fb_damage_clips()

 *   so we can selectively just transmit the damaged area to a

 *   command-only display.

 * - Enable mixing of more planes, possibly at the cost of moving away

 *   from using the simple framebuffer pipeline.

 * - Enable output to bridges such as the AV8100 HDMI encoder from

 *   the DSI bridge.

	/*

	 * Using this function is necessary to commit atomic updates

	 * that need the CRTC to be enabled before a commit, as is

	 * the case with e.g. DSI displays.

	/*

	 * If no other bridge was found, check if we have a DPI panel or

	 * any other bridge connected directly to the MCDE DPI output.

	 * If a DSI bridge is found, DSI will take precedence.

	 *

 * This function accepts two users:

 * Split is introduced for workaround scaler's input/output size limitation.

 * The idea is simple, if one scaler can not fit the requirement, use two.

 * So split splits the big source image to two half parts (left/right) and do

 * But split also imports an edge problem in the middle of the image when

 * scaling, to avoid it, split isn't a simple half-and-half, but add an extra

 * pixels (overlap) to both side, after split the left/right will be:

 * - left: [0, src_length/2 + overlap]

 * - right: [src_length/2 - overlap, src_length]

 * The extra overlap do eliminate the edge problem, but which may also generates

 * unnecessary pixels when scaling, we need to crop them before scaler output

 * the result to the next stage. and for the how to crop, it depends on the

 * unneeded pixels, another words the position where overlay has been added.

 * DOC: Broadcom V3D MMU

 *

 * The V3D 3.x hardware (compared to VC4) now includes an MMU.  It has

 * a single level of page tables for the V3D's 4GB address space to

 * map to AXI bus addresses, thus it could need up to 4MB of

 *

 * Because the 4MB of contiguous memory for page tables is precious,

 * and switching between them is expensive, we load all BOs into the

 * same 4GB address space.

 *

 * To protect clients from each other, we should use the GMP to

 * quickly mask out (at 128kb granularity) what pages are available to

 * each client.  This is not yet implemented.

 * Unmaps the DMA mappings.

 * FIXME: Is this a NoOp on x86? Also

/*

 * Unmap a DMA mapping.

/*

 * If mode = 0, count how many descriptors are needed.

 * If mode = 1, Map the DMA pages for the device, put together and map also the descriptors.

 * Descriptors are run in reverse order by the hardware because we are not allowed to update the

 * 'next' field without syncing calls when the descriptor is already mapped.

/*

 * Function that frees up all resources for a blit. It is usable even if the

 * blit info has only been partially built as long as the status enum is consistent

 * with the actual status of the used resources.

/*

 * Fire a blit engine.

/*

 * Obtain a page pointer array and lock all pages into system memory. A segmentation violation will

 * occur here if the calling user does not have access to the submitted address.

/*

 * Allocate DMA capable memory for the blit descriptor chain, and an array that keeps track of the

 * pages we allocate. We don't want to use kmalloc for the descriptor chain because it may be

 * quite large for some blits, and pages don't need to be contiguous.

/*

 * The dmablit part of the IRQ handler. Trying to do only reasonably fast things here.

 * The rest, like unmapping and freeing memory for done blits is done in a separate workqueue

 * task. Basically the task of the interrupt handler is to submit a new blit to the engine, while

 * the workqueue task takes care of processing associated with the old blit.

		/*

		 * Clear transfer done flag.

		/*

		 * Abort transfer after one second.

/*

 * Check whether this blit is still active, performing necessary locking.

	/*

	 * Allow for handle wraparounds.

/*

 * Sync. Wait for at least three seconds for the blit to be performed.

/*

 * A timer that regularly polls the blit engine in cases where we don't have interrupts:

 * a) Broken hardware (typically those that don't have any video capture facility).

 * b) Blit abort. The hardware doesn't send an interrupt when a blit is aborted.

 * The timer and hardware IRQ's can and do work in parallel. If the hardware has

 * irqs, it will shorten the latency somewhat.

	       /*

		* Rerun handler to delete timer if engines are off, and

		* to shorten abort latency. This is a little nasty.

/*

 * Workqueue task that frees data and mappings associated with a blit.

 * Also wakes up waiting processes. Each of these tasks handles one

 * blit engine only and may not be called on each interrupt.

/*

 * Init all blit engines. Currently we use two, but some hardware have 4.

/*

 * Build all info and do all mappings required for a blit.

	/*

	 * Below check is a driver limitation, not a hardware one. We

	 * don't want to lock unused pages, and don't want to incoporate the

	 * extra logic of avoiding them. Make sure there are no.

	 * (Not a big limitation anyway.)

	/*

	 * Don't lock an arbitrary large number of pages, since that causes a

	 * DOS security hole.

	/*

	 * we allow a negative fb stride to allow flipping of images in

	 * transfer.

	/*

	 * A hardware bug seems to be worked around if system memory addresses start on

	 * 16 byte boundaries. This seems a bit restrictive however. VIA is contacted

	 * about this. Meanwhile, impose the following restrictions:

/*

 * Reserve one free slot in the blit queue. Will wait for one second for one

 * to become available. Otherwise -EBUSY is returned.

/*

 * Hand back a free slot if we changed our mind.

/*

 * Grab a free slot. Build blit info and queue a blit.

/*

 * Sync on a previously submitted blit. Note that the X server use signals extensively, and

 * that there is a very big probability that this IOCTL will be interrupted by a signal. In that

 * case it returns with -EAGAIN for the signal to be delivered.

 * The caller should then reissue the IOCTL. This is similar to what is being done for drmGetLock().

/*

 * Queue a blit and hand back a handle to be used for sync. This IOCTL may be interrupted by a signal

 * while waiting for a free slot in the blit queue. In that case it returns with -EAGAIN and should

 * be reissued. See the above IOCTL code.

	 * ordering. The bridge wants the panel to be there when it probes.

	 * The panel wants its HPD GPIO (provided by sn65dsi86 on some boards)

	 * when it probes. The panel and maybe backlight might want the DDC

	 * bus. Soon the PWM provided by the bridge chip will have the same

	 * problem. Having sub-devices allows the some sub devices to finish

	 * probing even if others return -EPROBE_DEFER and gets us around the

	 * problems.

	/*

	 * NOTE: At the end of the AUX channel probe we'll add the aux device

	 * for the bridge. This is because the bridge can't be used until the

	 * AUX channel is there and this is a very simple solution to the

	 * dependency problem.

	 * This is a huge hack to workaround a problem where the dw_hdmi i2c

	 * bus could sometimes get wedged.  Once wedged there doesn't appear

	 * to be any way to unwedge it (including the HDMI_I2CM_SOFTRSTZ)

	 * other than pulsing the SDA line.

	 *

	 * We appear to be able to pulse the SDA line (in the eyes of dw_hdmi)

	 * by:

	 * 1. Remux the pin as a GPIO output, driven low.

	 * 2. Wait a little while.  1 ms seems to work, but we'll do 10.

	 * 3. Immediately jump to remux the pin as dw_hdmi i2c again.

	 *

	 * At the moment of remuxing, the line will still be low due to its

	 * recent stint as an output, but then it will be pulled high by the

	 * (presumed) external pullup.  dw_hdmi seems to see this as a rising

	 * edge and that seems to get it out of its jam.

	 *

	 * This wedging was only ever seen on one TV, and only on one of

	 * its HDMI ports.  It happened when the TV was powered on while the

	 * device was plugged in.  A scope trace shows the TV bringing both SDA

	 * and SCL low, then bringing them both back up at roughly the same

	 * time.  Presumably this confuses dw_hdmi because it saw activity but

	 * no real STOP (maybe it thinks there's another master on the bus?).

	 * Giving it a clean rising edge of SDA while SCL is already high

	 * presumably makes dw_hdmi see a STOP which seems to bring dw_hdmi out

	 * of its stupor.

	 *

	 * Note that after coming back alive, transfers seem to immediately

	 * resume, so if we unwedge due to a timeout we should wait a little

	 * longer for our transfer to finish, since it might have just started

	 * now.

		/* Even if the bandwidth/plane required for a single frame is

 * DOC: VC4 GEM BO management support

 *

 * The VC4 GPU architecture (both scanout and rendering) has direct

 * access to system memory with no MMU in between.  To support it, we

 * use the GEM CMA helper functions to allocate contiguous ranges of

 * physical memory for our BOs.

 *

 * Since the CMA allocator is very slow, we keep a cache of recently

 * freed BOs around so that the kernel's allocation of objects for 3D

 * rendering can return quickly.

/* Takes ownership of *name and returns the appropriate slot for it in

 * the bo_labels[] array, extending it as necessary.

 *

 * This is inefficient and could use a hash table instead of walking

 * an array and strcmp()ing.  However, the assumption is that user

 * labeling will be infrequent (scanout buffers and other long-lived

 * objects, or debug driver builds), so we can live with it for now.

		/* Free user BO label slots on last unreference.

		 * Slots are just where we track the stats for a given

		 * name, and once a name is unused we can reuse that

		 * slot.

		/* Rebase the old cached BO lists to their new list

		 * head locations.

 And initialize the brand new BO list heads. */

	/* list_del_init() is used here because the caller might release

	 * the purgeable lock in order to acquire the madv one and update the

	 * madv status.

	 * During this short period of time a user might decide to mark

	 * the BO as unpurgeable, and if bo->madv is set to

	 * VC4_MADV_DONTNEED it will try to remove the BO from the

	 * purgeable list which will fail if the ->next/prev fields

	 * are set to LIST_POISON1/LIST_POISON2 (which is what

	 * list_del() does).

	 * Re-initializing the list element guarantees that list_del()

	 * will work correctly even if it's a NOP.

		/* Release the purgeable lock while we're purging the BO so

		 * that other people can continue inserting things in the

		 * purgeable pool without having to wait for all BOs to be

		 * purged.

		/* Since we released the purgeable pool lock before acquiring

		 * the BO madv one, the user may have marked the BO as WILLNEED

		 * and re-used it in the meantime.

		 * Before purging the BO we need to make sure

		 * - it is still marked as DONTNEED

		 * - it has not been re-inserted in the purgeable list

		 * - it is not used by HW blocks

/**

 * DOC: VC4 CRTC module

 *

 * In VC4, the Pixel Valve is what most closely corresponds to the

 * DRM's concept of a CRTC.  The PV generates video timings from the

 * encoder's clock plus its configuration.  It pulls scaled pixels from

 * the HVS at that timing, and feeds it to the encoder.

 *

 * However, the DRM CRTC also collects the configuration of all the

 * DRM planes attached to it.  As a result, the CRTC is also

 * responsible for writing the display list for the HVS channel that

 * the CRTC will use.

 *

 * The 2835 has 3 different pixel valves.  pv0 in the audio power

 * domain feeds DSI0 or DPI, while pv1 feeds DS1 or SMI.  pv2 in the

 * image domain can feed either HDMI or the SDTV controller.  The

 * pixel valve chooses from the CPRMAN clocks (HSM for HDMI, VEC for

 * SDTV, etc.) according to which output type is chosen in the mux.

 *

 * For power management, the pixel valve's registers are all clocked

 * by the AXI clock, while the timings and FIFOs make use of the

 * output-specific clock.  Since the encoders also directly consume

 * the CPRMAN clocks, and know what timings they need, they are the

 * ones that set the clock.

		/*

		 * We are in active scanout and can get some meaningful results

		 * from HVS. The actual PV scanout can not trail behind more

		 * than fifo_lines as that is the fifo's capacity. Assume that

		 * in active scanout the HVS and PV work in lockstep wrt. HVS

		 * refilling the fifo and PV consuming from the fifo, ie.

		 * whenever the PV consumes and frees up a scanline in the

		 * fifo, the HVS will immediately refill it, therefore

		 * incrementing vpos. Therefore we choose HVS read position -

		 * fifo size in scanlines as a estimate of the real scanout

		 * position of the PV.

	/*

	 * Less: This happens when we are in vblank and the HVS, after getting

	 * the VSTART restart signal from the PV, just started refilling its

	 * fifo with new lines from the top-most lines of the new framebuffers.

	 * The PV does not scan out in vblank, so does not remove lines from

	 * the fifo, so the fifo will be full quickly and the HVS has to pause.

	 * We can't get meaningful readings wrt. scanline position of the PV

	 * and need to make things up in a approximative but consistent way.

		/*

		 * Assume the irq handler got called close to first

		 * line of vblank, so PV has about a full vblank

		 * scanlines to go, and as a base timestamp use the

		 * one taken at entry into vblank irq handler, so it

		 * is not affected by random delays due to lock

		 * contention on event_lock or vblank_time lock in

		 * the core.

		/*

		 * If the HVS fifo is not yet full then we know for certain

		 * we are at the very beginning of vblank, as the hvs just

		 * started refilling, and the stime and etime timestamps

		 * truly correspond to start of vblank.

		 *

		 * Unfortunately there's no way to report this to upper levels

		 * and make it more useful.

		/*

		 * No clue where we are inside vblank. Return a vpos of zero,

		 * which will cause calling code to just return the etime

		 * timestamp uncorrected. At least this is no worse than the

		 * standard fallback.

	/*

	 * Pixels are pulled from the HVS if the number of bytes is

	 * lower than the FIFO full level.

	 *

	 * The latency of the pixel fetch mechanism is 6 pixels, so we

	 * need to convert those 6 pixels in bytes, depending on the

	 * format, and then subtract that from the length of the FIFO

/**

 * DOC: Interrupt management for the V3D engine

 *

 * We have an interrupt status register (V3D_INTCTL) which reports

 * interrupts, and where writing 1 bits clears those interrupts.

 * There are also a pair of interrupt registers

 * (V3D_INTENA/V3D_INTDIS) where writing a 1 to their bits enables or

 * disables that specific interrupt, and 0s written are ignored

 * (reading either one returns the set of enabled interrupts).

 *

 * When we take a binning flush done interrupt, we need to submit the

 * next frame for binning and move the finished frame to the render

 * thread.

 *

 * When we take a render frame interrupt, we need to wake the

 * processes waiting for some frame to be done, and get the next frame

 * submitted ASAP (so the hardware doesn't sit idle when there's work

 * to do).

 *

 * When we take the binner out of memory interrupt, we need to

 * allocate some new memory and pass it to the binner so that the

 * current job can make progress.

		/* If we had overflow memory allocated previously,

		 * then that chunk will free when the current bin job

		 * is done.  If we don't have a bin job running, then

		 * the chunk will be done whenever the list of render

		 * jobs has drained.

			/* There's nothing queued in the hardware, so

			 * the old slot is free immediately.

	/* Only submit the next job in the bin list if it matches the perfmon

	 * attached to the one that just finished (or if both jobs don't have

	 * perfmon attached to them).

 Stop the perfmon so that the next bin job can be started. */

	/* Only stop the perfmon if following jobs in the queue don't expect it

	 * to be enabled.

	/* If there's a render job waiting, start it. If this is not the case

	 * we may have to unblock the binner if it's been stalled because of

	 * perfmon (this can be checked by comparing the perfmon attached to

	 * the finished renderjob to the one attached to the next bin job: if

	 * they don't match, this means the binner is stalled and should be

	 * restarted).

	/* Acknowledge the interrupts we're handling here. The binner

 * The BCM2711 HVS has up to 7 outputs connected to the pixelvalves and

 *

 * The naive (and our initial) implementation would just iterate over

 * all the active CRTCs, try to find a suitable FIFO, and then remove it

 * from the pool of available FIFOs. However, there are a few corner

 * cases that need to be considered:

 *

 * - When running in a dual-display setup (so with two CRTCs involved),

 *   we can update the state of a single CRTC (for example by changing

 *   its mode using xrandr under X11) without affecting the other. In

 *   this case, the other CRTC wouldn't be in the state at all, so we

 *   need to consider all the running CRTCs in the DRM device to assign

 *   a FIFO, not just the one in the state.

 *

 * - To fix the above, we can't use drm_atomic_get_crtc_state on all

 *   enabled CRTCs to pull their CRTC state into the global state, since

 *   a page flip would start considering their vblank to complete. Since

 *   we don't have a guarantee that they are actually active, that

 *   vblank might never happen, and shouldn't even be considered if we

 *   want to do a page flip on a single CRTC. That can be tested by

 *   doing a modetest -v first on HDMI1 and then on HDMI0.

 *

 * - Since we need the pixelvalve to be disabled and enabled back when

 *   the FIFO is changed, we should keep the FIFO assigned for as long

 *   as the CRTC is enabled, only considering it free again once that

 *   CRTC has been disabled. This can be tested by booting X11 on a

 *   single display, and changing the resolution down and then back up.

 If we're disabling our CRTC, we put back our channel */

		/*

		 * The problem we have to solve here is that we have

		 * up to 7 encoders, connected to up to 6 CRTCs.

		 *

		 * Those CRTCs, depending on the instance, can be

		 * routed to 1, 2 or 3 HVS FIFOs, and we need to set

		 * the change the muxing between FIFOs and outputs in

		 * the HVS accordingly.

		 *

		 * It would be pretty hard to come up with an

		 * algorithm that would generically solve

		 * this. However, the current routing trees we support

		 * allow us to simplify a bit the problem.

		 *

		 * Indeed, with the current supported layouts, if we

		 * try to assign in the ascending crtc index order the

		 * FIFOs, we can't fall into the situation where an

		 * earlier CRTC that had multiple routes is assigned

		 * one that was the only option for a later CRTC.

 * DOC: VC4 HVS module.

 *

 * The Hardware Video Scaler (HVS) is the piece of hardware that does

 * translation, scaling, colorspace conversion, and compositing of

 * pixels stored in framebuffers into a FIFO of pixels going out to

 * the Pixel Valve (CRTC).  It operates at the system clock rate (the

 * system audio clock gate, specifically), which is much higher than

 * the pixel clock rate.

 *

 * There is a single global HVS, with multiple output FIFOs that can

 * be consumed by the PVs.  This file just manages the resources for

 * the HVS, while the vc4_crtc.c code actually drives HVS setup for

 * each CRTC.

/* The filter kernel is composed of dwords each containing 3 9-bit

 * signed integers packed next to each other.

/* The whole filter kernel is arranged as the coefficients 0-16 going

 * up, then a pad, then 17-31 going down and reversed within the

 * dwords.  This means that a linear phase kernel (where it's

 * symmetrical at the boundary between 15 and 16) has the last 5

 * dwords matching the first 5, but reversed.

/* Recommended B=1/3, C=1/3 filter choice from Mitchell/Netravali.

 * http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~fussell/courses/cs384g/lectures/mitchell/Mitchell.pdf

	/* The LUT memory is laid out with each HVS channel in order,

	 * each of which takes 256 writes for R, 256 for G, then 256

	 * for B.

	/* Turn on the scaler, which will wait for vstart to start

	 * compositing.

	 * When feeding the transposer, we should operate in oneshot

	 * mode.

	/* Reload the LUT, since the SRAMs would have been disabled if

	 * all CRTCs had SCALER_DISPBKGND_GAMMA unset at once.

 Once we leave, the scaler should be disabled and its fifo empty. */

	/* The pixelvalve can only feed one encoder (and encoders are

	 * 1:1 with connectors.)

 Account for SCALER_CTL0_END. */

			/* We need to enable background fill when a plane

			 * could be alpha blending from the background, i.e.

			 * where no other plane is underneath. It suffices to

			 * consider the first active plane here since we set

			 * needs_bg_fill such that either the first plane

			 * already needs it or all planes on top blend from

			 * the first or a lower plane.

		/* This sets a black background color fill, as is the case

		 * with other DRM drivers.

	/* Only update DISPLIST if the CRTC was already running and is not

	 * being disabled.

	 * vc4_crtc_enable() takes care of updating the dlist just after

	 * re-enabling VBLANK interrupts and before enabling the engine.

	 * If the CRTC is being disabled, there's no point in updating this

	 * information.

			/* Unsetting DISPBKGND_GAMMA skips the gamma lut step

 *   - The HDMI driver needs to be bound after the HVS so that we can

	/*

	 * If we support addressing a maximum of 32 bits of physical memory

	 * and if the host1x firewall is enabled, there's no need to enable

	 * IOMMU support. This can happen for example on Tegra20, Tegra30

	 * and Tegra114.

	 *

	 * Tegra124 and later can address up to 34 bits of physical memory and

	 * many platforms come equipped with more than 2 GiB of system memory,

	 * which requires crossing the 4 GiB boundary. But there's a catch: on

	 * SoCs before Tegra186 (i.e. Tegra124 and Tegra210), the host1x can

	 * only address up to 32 bits of memory in GATHER opcodes, which means

	 * that command buffers need to either be in the first 2 GiB of system

	 * memory (which could quickly lead to memory exhaustion), or command

	 * buffers need to be treated differently from other buffers (which is

	 * not possible with the current ABI).

	 *

	 * A third option is to use the IOMMU in these cases to make sure all

	 * buffers will be mapped into a 32-bit IOVA space that host1x can

	 * address. This allows all of the system memory to be used and works

	 * within the limitations of the host1x on these SoCs.

	 *

	 * In summary, default to enable IOMMU on Tegra124 and later. For any

	 * of the earlier SoCs, only use the IOMMU for additional safety when

	 * the host1x firewall is disabled.

	/*

	 * We may not always want to enable IOMMU support (for example if the

	 * host1x firewall is already enabled and we don't support addressing

	 * more than 32 bits of physical memory), so check for that first.

	 *

	 * Similarly, if host1x is already attached to an IOMMU (via the DMA

	 * API), don't try to attach again.

	/*

	 * If we're not behind an IOMMU make sure we don't get push buffers

	 * that are allocated outside of the range addressable by the GATHER

	 * opcode.

	 *

	 * Newer generations of Tegra (Tegra186 and later) support a wide

	 * variant of the GATHER opcode that allows addressing more bits.

/*

 * The IC Resizer has a restriction that the output frame from the

 * (lines).

 *

 * The image converter attempts to split up a conversion when

 * the desired output (converted) frame resolution exceeds the

 * IC resizer limit of 1024 in either dimension.

 *

 * If either dimension of the output frame exceeds the limit, the

 * dimension is split into 1, 2, or 4 equal stripes, for a maximum

 * of 4*4 or 16 tiles. A conversion is then carried out for each

 * tile (but taking care to pass the full frame stride length to

 * the DMA channel's parameter memory!). IDMA double-buffering is used

 * to convert each tile back-to-back when possible (see note below

 * when double_buffering boolean is set).

 *

 * Note that the input frame must be split up into the same number

 * of tiles as the output frame:

 * A note about RMI4 F11 register structure.

 *

 * The properties for a given sensor are described by its query registers.  The

 * number of query registers and the layout of their contents are described by

 * the F11 device queries as well as the sensor query information.

 *

 * Similarly, each sensor has control registers that govern its behavior.  The

 * size and layout of the control registers for a given sensor can be determined

 * by parsing that sensors query registers.

 *

 * And in a likewise fashion, each sensor has data registers where it reports

 * its touch data and other interesting stuff.  The size and layout of a

 * sensors data registers must be determined by parsing its query registers.

 *

 * The short story is that we need to read and parse a lot of query

 * registers in order to determine the attributes of a sensor. Then

 * we need to use that data to compute the size of the control and data

 * registers for sensor.

 *

 * The end result is that we have a number of structs that aren't used to

 * directly generate the input events, but their size, location and contents

 * are critical to determining where the data we are interested in lives.

 *

 * At this time, the driver does not yet comprehend all possible F11

 * Windows 8.

 *

 * (C) Copyright 2014 Intel Corporation

/*

 * Some of the buttons like volume up/down are auto repeat, while others

 * are not. To support both, we register two platform devices, and put

 * buttons into them based on whether the key should be auto repeat.

/*

 * Some 2-in-1s which use the soc_button_array driver have this ugly issue in

 * their DSDT where the _LID method modifies the irq-type settings of the GPIOs

 * used for the power and home buttons. The intend of this AML code is to

 * disable these buttons when the lid is closed.

 * The AML does this by directly poking the GPIO controllers registers. This is

 * problematic because when re-enabling the irq, which happens whenever _LID

 * gets called with the lid open (e.g. on boot and on resume), it sets the

 * irq-type to IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW. Where as the gpio-keys driver programs the

 * type to, and expects it to be, IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH.

 * To work around this we don't set gpio_keys_button.gpio on these 2-in-1s,

 * instead we get the irq for the GPIO ourselves, configure it as

 * IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW (to match how the _LID AML code configures it) and pass

 * the irq in gpio_keys_button.irq. Below is a list of affected devices.

		/*

		 * Acer Switch 10 SW5-012. _LID method messes with home- and

		 * power-button GPIO IRQ settings. When (re-)enabling the irq

		 * it ors in its own flags without clearing the previous set

		 * ones, leading to an irq-type of IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW |

		 * IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH causing a continuous interrupt storm.

		/*

		 * Acer One S1003. _LID method messes with power-button GPIO

		 * IRQ settings, leading to a non working power-button.

		/*

			 * In some cases the resources table we parse points to

			 * such a virtual GPIO, since these are not real GPIOs

			 * we do not have a driver for these so they will never

 * This driver registers up to 3 input devices: one representing capacitive or

 * axial sliders presented by the device.

	/*

	 * Volunteer all active channels to participate in ATI when REDO-ATI is

	/*

	 * Configure the device to automatically switch between normal and low-

	/*

	 * As per the datasheet, enable streaming during normal-power mode if

	 * either slider is in use. In that case, the device returns to event

	 * mode during low-power mode.

	/*

	 * The REDO-ATI and ATI channel selection fields must be written in the

			/*

			 * Hall-effect sensing repurposes a pair of dedicated

			 * channels, only one of which reports events.

	/*

	 * The device resets itself if its own watchdog bites, which can happen

	 * in the event of an I2C communication error. In this case, the device

	 * asserts a SHOW_RESET interrupt and all registers must be restored.

		 * Report BTN_TOUCH if any channel that participates in the

	 * the interrupt handler does not return before this time.

	/*

	 * Unsolicited I2C communication prompts the device to assert its RDY

	 * pin, so disable the interrupt line until the operation is finished

	 * and RDY has been deasserted.

	/*

	 * Automatic power mode switching must be disabled before the device is

	 * forced into any particular power mode. In this case, the device will

	 * transition into normal-power mode.

	/*

	 * The following check ensures the device has completed its transition

 * A driver for the Griffin Technology, Inc. "PowerMate" USB controller dial.

 *

 * v1.1, (c)2002 William R Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com>

 *

 * This device is a anodised aluminium knob which connects over USB. It can measure

 * clockwise and anticlockwise rotation. The dial also acts as a pushbutton with

 * a spring for automatic release. The base contains a pair of LEDs which illuminate

 * the translucent base. It rotates without limit and reports its relative rotation

 * back to the host when polled by the USB controller.

 *

 * Testing with the knob I have has shown that it measures approximately 94 "clicks"

 * for one full rotation. Testing with my High Speed Rotation Actuator (ok, it was

 * a variable speed cordless electric drill) has shown that the device can measure

 * speeds of up to 7 clicks either clockwise or anticlockwise between pollings from

 * the host. If it counts more than 7 clicks before it is polled, it will wrap back

 * to zero and start counting again. This was at quite high speed, however, almost

 * certainly faster than the human hand could turn it. Griffin say that it loses a

 * pulse or two on a direction change; the granularity is so fine that I never

 * noticed this in practice.

 *

 * The device's microcontroller can be programmed to set the LED to either a constant

 * intensity, or to a rhythmic pulsing. Several patterns and speeds are available.

 *

 * Griffin were very happy to provide documentation and free hardware for development.

 *

 * Some userspace tools are available on the web: http://sowerbutts.com/powermate/

	/*

	 * The first addressing attempt outside of a communication window fails

	 * and must be retried, after which the device clock stretches until it

	 * is available.

		/*

		 * This delay saves the bus controller the trouble of having to

		 * tolerate a relatively long clock-stretching period while the

		 * CRC is calculated.

	/*

	 * The device opens a bootloader polling window for 2 ms following the

	 * release of reset. If the host cannot establish communication during

	 * this time frame, it must cycle reset again.

	/*

	 * Addressing the device outside of a communication window prompts it

	 * to assert the RDY output, so disable the interrupt line to prevent

	 * the handler from servicing a false interrupt.

	/*

	 * The device reserves 0xFFFF for coordinates that correspond to slots

	 * which are not in a state of touch.

	/*

	 * A000 and B000 devices use 8-bit and 16-bit addressing, respectively.

	 * Querying an A000 device's version information with 16-bit addressing

	 * gives the appearance that the data is shifted by one byte; a nonzero

	 * leading array element suggests this could be the case (in which case

	 * the missing zero is prepended).

	/*

	 * With the product number recognized yet shifted by one byte, open the

	 * bootloader and wait for user space to convert the A000 device into a

	 * B000 device via new firmware.

	/*

	 * The following delay allows ATI to complete before the open and close

	 * callbacks are free to elicit I2C communication. Any attempts to read

	 * from or write to the device during this time may face extended clock

	 * stretching and prompt the I2C controller to report an error.

	/*

	 * This check is purely a precaution, as the device does not assert the

	 * RDY output during bootloader mode. If the device operates outside of

	 * bootloader mode, the input device is guaranteed to be allocated.

	/*

	 * Once the communication window is closed, a small delay is added to

	 * ensure the device's RDY output has been deasserted by the time the

	 * interrupt handler returns.

	/*

	 * Firmware exported from the vendor's configuration tool deviates from

	 * standard ihex as follows: (1) the checksum for records corresponding

	 * to user-exported settings is not recalculated, and (2) an address of

	 * 0xFFFF is used for the EOF record.

	 *

	 * Because the ihex2fw tool tolerates neither (1) nor (2), the slightly

	 * nonstandard ihex firmware is parsed directly by the driver.

	/*

	 * Disable the interrupt line in case the first attempt(s) to enter the

	 * bootloader don't happen quickly enough, in which case the device may

	 * assert the RDY output until the next attempt.

	/*

	 * If the input device was not allocated already, it is guaranteed to

	 * be allocated by this point and can finally be registered.

 * The touchscreen interface operates as follows:

 * 1) Pen is pressed against the touchscreen.

 * 2) TSC200X performs AD conversion.

 * 3) After the conversion is done TSC200X drives DAV line down.

 * 4) GPIO IRQ is received and tsc200x_irq_thread() is scheduled.

 * 5) tsc200x_irq_thread() queues up a transfer to fetch the x, y, z1, z2

 *    values.

 * 6) tsc200x_irq_thread() reports coordinates to input layer and sets up

 *    tsc200x_penup_timer() to be called after TSC200X_PENUP_TIME_MS (40ms).

 * 7) When the penup timer expires, there have not been touch or DAV interrupts

 *    during the last 40ms which means the pen has been lifted.

 *

 * ESD recovery via a hardware reset is done if the TSC200X doesn't respond

 * after a configurable period (in ms) of activity. If esd_timeout is 0, the

 * watchdog is disabled.

/*

 * Module parameters

/*

 * Set internal pull up for pen detect.

 *

 * Pull up is in the range 1.02k (least sensitive) to 64k (most sensitive)

 * i.e. pull up resistance = 64k Ohms / rpu.

 *

 * Adjust this value if you are having problems with pen detect not

 * detecting any down event.

/*

 * Set current used for pressure measurement.

 *

 * Set pil = 2 to use 400uA

 *     pil = 1 to use 200uA and

 *     pil = 0 to disable pressure measurement.

 *

 * This is used to increase the range of values returned by the adc

 * when measureing touchpanel pressure.

/*

 * Set threshold for pressure measurement.

 *

 * Pen down pressure below threshold is ignored.

/*

 * Set adc sample delay.

 *

 * For accurate touchpanel measurements, some settling time may be

 * required between the switch matrix applying a voltage across the

 * touchpanel plate and the ADC sampling the signal.

 *

 * This delay can be set by setting delay = n, where n is the array

 * position of the delay in the array delay_table below.

 * Long delays > 1ms are supported for completeness, but are not

 * recommended.

/*

 * Set five_wire = 1 to use a 5 wire touchscreen.

 *

 * NOTE: Five wire mode does not allow for readback of pressure.

/*

 * Set adc mask function.

 *

 * Sources of glitch noise, such as signals driving an LCD display, may feed

 * through to the touch screen plates and affect measurement accuracy. In

 * order to minimise this, a signal may be applied to the MASK pin to delay or

 * synchronise the sampling.

 *

 * 0 = No delay or sync

 * 1 = High on pin stops conversions

 * 2 = Edge triggered, edge on pin delays conversion by delay param (above)

 * 3 = Edge triggered, edge on pin starts conversion after delay param

/*

 * The keyboard and touchpad controller on the MacBookAir6, MacBookPro12,

 * MacBook8 and newer can be driven either by USB or SPI. However the USB

 * pins are only connected on the MacBookAir6 and 7 and the MacBookPro12.

 * All others need this driver. The interface is selected using ACPI methods:

 *

 * * UIEN ("USB Interface Enable"): If invoked with argument 1, disables SPI

 *   and enables USB. If invoked with argument 0, disables USB.

 * * UIST ("USB Interface Status"): Returns 1 if USB is enabled, 0 otherwise.

 * * SIEN ("SPI Interface Enable"): If invoked with argument 1, disables USB

 *   and enables SPI. If invoked with argument 0, disables SPI.

 * * SIST ("SPI Interface Status"): Returns 1 if SPI is enabled, 0 otherwise.

 * * ISOL: Resets the four GPIO pins used for SPI. Intended to be invoked with

 *   argument 1, then once more with argument 0.

 *

 * UIEN and UIST are only provided on models where the USB pins are connected.

 *

 * SPI-based Protocol

 * ------------------

 *

 * The device and driver exchange messages (struct message); each message is

 * encapsulated in one or more packets (struct spi_packet). There are two types

 * of exchanges: reads, and writes. A read is signaled by a GPE, upon which one

 * message can be read from the device. A write exchange consists of writing a

 * command message, immediately reading a short status packet, and then, upon

 * receiving a GPE, reading the response message. Write exchanges cannot be

 * interleaved, i.e. a new write exchange must not be started till the previous

 * write exchange is complete. Whether a received message is part of a read or

 * write exchange is indicated in the encapsulating packet's flags field.

 *

 * A single message may be too large to fit in a single packet (which has a

 * fixed, 256-byte size). In that case it will be split over multiple,

 * consecutive packets.

 ChromeOS EC keyboard driver



 Copyright (C) 2012 Google, Inc.



 This driver uses the ChromeOS EC byte-level message-based protocol for

 communicating the keyboard state (which keys are pressed) from a keyboard EC

 to the AP over some bus (such as i2c, lpc, spi).  The EC does debouncing,

 but everything else (including deghosting) is done here.  The main

 motivation for this is to keep the EC firmware as simple as possible, since

 it cannot be easily upgraded and EC flash/IRAM space is relatively

 expensive.

/**

 * struct cros_ec_keyb - Structure representing EC keyboard device

 *

 * @rows: Number of rows in the keypad

 * @cols: Number of columns in the keypad

 * @row_shift: log2 or number of rows, rounded up

 * @keymap_data: Matrix keymap data used to convert to keyscan values

 * @ghost_filter: true to enable the matrix key-ghosting filter

 * @valid_keys: bitmap of existing keys for each matrix column

 * @old_kb_state: bitmap of keys pressed last scan

 * @dev: Device pointer

 * @ec: Top level ChromeOS device to use to talk to EC

 * @idev: The input device for the matrix keys.

 * @bs_idev: The input device for non-matrix buttons and switches (or NULL).

 * @notifier: interrupt event notifier for transport devices

 * @function_row_physmap: An array of the encoded rows/columns for the top

 *                        row function keys, in an order from left to right

 * @num_function_row_keys: The number of top row keys in a custom keyboard

 * Returns true when there is at least one combination of pressed keys that

 * results in ghosting.

	/*

	 * Ghosting happens if for any pressed key X there are other keys

	 * in the following diagram:

	 *

	 * . . Y . g .

	 * . . . . . .

	 * . . . . . .

	 * . . X . Z .

	 *

	 * In this case only X, Y, and Z are pressed, but g appears to be

	 * pressed too (see Wikipedia).

/*

 * Compares the new keyboard state to the old one and produces key

 * press/release events accordingly.  The keyboard state is 13 bytes (one byte

 * per column)

		/*

		 * Simple-minded solution: ignore this state. The obvious

		 * improvement is to only ignore changes to keys involved in

		 * the ghosting, but process the other changes.

/**

 *

 * This takes a bitmap of buttons or switches from the EC and reports events,

 * syncing at the end.

 *

 * @ckdev: The keyboard device.

 * @ev_type: The input event type (e.g., EV_KEY).

 * @mask: A bitmap of buttons from the EC.

	/*

	 * If not wake enabled, discard key state changes during

	 * suspend. Switches will be re-checked in

	 * cros_ec_keyb_resume() to be sure nothing is lost.

/*

 * @result: Where we'll store the result; a union

 * @result_size: The size of the result.  Expected to be the size of one of

/**

 * Make sure nothing is coming from the keyboard and disturbs our

 * internal state.

/*

 * atkbd_select_set checks if a keyboard has a working Set 3 support, and

/*

 * SYSFS interface for enabling/disabling keys and switches:

 *

 * There are 4 attributes under /sys/devices/platform/gpio-keys/

 *	keys [ro]              - bitmap of keys (EV_KEY) which can be

 *	                         disabled

 *	switches [ro]          - bitmap of switches (EV_SW) which can be

 *	                         disabled

 *	disabled_keys [rw]     - bitmap of keys currently disabled

 *	disabled_switches [rw] - bitmap of switches currently disabled

 *

 * Userland can change these values and hence disable event generation

 * for each key (or switch). Disabling a key means its interrupt line

 * is disabled.

 *

 * For example, if we have following switches set up as gpio-keys:

 *	SW_DOCK = 5

 *	SW_CAMERA_LENS_COVER = 9

 *	SW_KEYPAD_SLIDE = 10

 *	SW_FRONT_PROXIMITY = 11

 * This is read from switches:

 *	11-9,5

 * Next we want to disable proximity (11) and dock (5), we write:

 *	11,5

 * to file disabled_switches. Now proximity and dock IRQs are disabled.

 * This can be verified by reading the file disabled_switches:

 *	11,5

 * If we now want to enable proximity (11) switch we write:

 *	5

 * to disabled_switches.

 *

 * We can disable only those keys which don't allow sharing the irq.

 * LK keyboard driver for Linux, based on sunkbd.c (C) by Vojtech Pavlik

/*

 * DEC LK201 and LK401 keyboard driver for Linux (primary for DECstations

 * and VAXstations, but can also be used on any standard RS232 with an

 * adaptor).

 *

 * DISCLAIMER: This works for _me_. If you break anything by using the

 * information given below, I will _not_ be liable!

 *

 * RJ10 pinout:		To DE9:		Or DB25:

 *	1 - RxD <---->	Pin 3 (TxD) <->	Pin 2 (TxD)

 *	2 - GND <---->	Pin 5 (GND) <->	Pin 7 (GND)

 *	4 - TxD <---->	Pin 2 (RxD) <->	Pin 3 (RxD)

 *	3 - +12V (from HDD drive connector), DON'T connect to DE9 or DB25!!!

 *

 * Pin numbers for DE9 and DB25 are noted on the plug (quite small:). For

 * RJ10, it's like this:

 *

 *      __=__	Hold the plug in front of you, cable downwards,

 *     /___/|	nose is hidden behind the plug. Now, pin 1 is at

 *    |1234||	the left side, pin 4 at the right and 2 and 3 are

 *    |IIII||	in between, of course:)

 *    |    ||

 *    |____|/

 *      ||	So the adaptor consists of three connected cables

 *      ||	for data transmission (RxD and TxD) and signal ground.

 *		Additionally, you have to get +12V from somewhere.

 * Most easily, you'll get that from a floppy or HDD power connector.

 * It's the yellow cable there (black is ground and red is +5V).

 *

 * The keyboard and all the commands it understands are documented in

 * "VCB02 Video Subsystem - Technical Manual", EK-104AA-TM-001. This

 * document is LK201 specific, but LK401 is mostly compatible. It comes

 * up in LK201 mode and doesn't report any of the additional keys it

 * has. These need to be switched on with the LK_CMD_ENABLE_LK401

 * command. You'll find this document (scanned .pdf file) on MANX,

 * a search engine specific to DEC documentation. Try

 * http://www.vt100.net/manx/details?pn=EK-104AA-TM-001;id=21;cp=1

 *  - fix "analog" buttons (reported as digital now)

 *  - get rumble working

 *  - need USB IDs for other dance pads

 *

 * History:

 *

 * 2002-06-27 - 0.0.1 : first version, just said "XBOX HID controller"

 *

 * 2002-07-02 - 0.0.2 : basic working version

 *  - all axes and 9 of the 10 buttons work (german InterAct device)

 *  - the black button does not work

 *

 * 2002-07-14 - 0.0.3 : rework by Vojtech Pavlik

 *  - indentation fixes

 *  - usb + input init sequence fixes

 *

 * 2002-07-16 - 0.0.4 : minor changes, merge with Vojtech's v0.0.3

 *  - verified the lack of HID and report descriptors

 *  - verified that ALL buttons WORK

 *  - fixed d-pad to axes mapping

 *

 * 2002-07-17 - 0.0.5 : simplified d-pad handling

 *

 * 2004-10-02 - 0.0.6 : DDR pad support

 *  - borrowed from the XBOX linux kernel

 *  - USB id's for commonly used dance pads are present

 *  - dance pads will map D-PAD to buttons, not axes

 *  - pass the module paramater 'dpad_to_buttons' to force

 *    the D-PAD to map to buttons if your pad is not detected

 *

 * Later changes can be tracked in SCM.

 * Driver to use Handykey's Twiddler (the first edition, i.e. the one with

 * the RS232 interface) as a joystick under Linux

 *

 * The Twiddler is a one-handed chording keyboard featuring twelve buttons on

 * the front, six buttons on the top, and a built-in tilt sensor. The buttons

 * on the front, which are grouped as four rows of three buttons, are pressed

 * by the four fingers (this implies only one button per row can be held down

 * at the same time) and the buttons on the top are for the thumb. The tilt

 * sensor delivers X and Y axis data depending on how the Twiddler is held.

 * Additional information can be found at http://www.handykey.com.

 *

 * This driver does not use the Twiddler for its intended purpose, i.e. as

 * a chording keyboard, but as a joystick: pressing and releasing a button

 * immediately sends a corresponding button event, and tilting it generates

 * corresponding ABS_X and ABS_Y events. This turns the Twiddler into a game

 * controller with amazing 18 buttons :-)

 *

 * Note: The Twiddler2 (the successor of the Twiddler that connects directly

 * to the PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports) is NOT supported by this driver!

	 * We need to make sure that interrupt handler finishes using

/*

 * i8042_interrupt() is the most important function in this driver -

 * it handles the interrupts from the i8042, and sends incoming bytes

/*

 * When MUXERR condition is signalled the data register can only contain

 * 0xfd, 0xfe or 0xff if implementation follows the spec. Unfortunately

 * port the data came from and signal error leaving the data intact. They

 * _do not_ revert to legacy mode (actually I've never seen KBC reverting

 * to legacy mode yet, when we see one we'll add proper handling).

 * Anyway, we process 0xfc, 0xfd, 0xfe and 0xff as timeouts, and for the

 * rest assume that the data came from the same serio last byte

 *	Some access methods and an ISR is defined by the sub-driver

 *	(e.g. hp_sdc_mlc.c).  These methods are expected to provide a

 *	few bits of logic in addition to raw access to the HIL MLC,

 *	specifically, the ISR, which is entirely registered by the

 *	sub-driver and invoked directly, must check for record

 *	termination or packet match, at which point a semaphore must

 *	be cleared and then the hil_mlcs_tasklet must be scheduled.

 *

 *	The hil_mlcs_tasklet processes the state machine for all MLCs

 *	each time it runs, checking each MLC's progress at the current

 *	node in the state machine, and moving the MLC to subsequent nodes

 *	in the state machine when appropriate.  It will reschedule

 *	itself if output is pending.  (This rescheduling should be replaced

 *	at some point with a sub-driver-specific mechanism.)

 *

 *	A timer task prods the tasklet once per second to prevent

 *	hangups when attached devices do not return expected data

 *	and to initiate probes of the loop for new devices.

 * Helge Deller's original hilkbd.c port for PA-RISC.

 *

 *

 * Driver theory of operation:

 *

 * hp_sdc_put does all writing to the SDC.  ISR can run on a different

 * CPU than hp_sdc_put, but only one CPU runs hp_sdc_put at a time

 * (it cannot really benefit from SMP anyway.)  A tasket fit this perfectly.

 *

 * All data coming back from the SDC is sent via interrupt and can be read

 * fully in the ISR, so there are no latency/throughput problems there.

 * The problem is with output, due to the slow clock speed of the SDC

 * compared to the CPU.  This should not be too horrible most of the time,

 * but if used with HIL devices that support the multibyte transfer command,

 * keeping outbound throughput flowing at the 6500KBps that the HIL is

 * capable of is more than can be done at HZ=100.

 *

 * Busy polling for IBF clear wastes CPU cycles and bus cycles.  hp_sdc.ibf

 * is set to 0 when the IBF flag in the status register has cleared.  ISR

 * may do this, and may also access the parts of queued transactions related

 * to reading data back from the SDC, but otherwise will not touch the

 * hp_sdc state. Whenever a register is written hp_sdc.ibf is set to 1.

 *

 * The i8042 write index and the values in the 4-byte input buffer

 * starting at 0x70 are kept track of in hp_sdc.wi, and .r7[], respectively,

 * to minimize the amount of IO needed to the SDC.  However these values

 * do not need to be locked since they are only ever accessed by hp_sdc_put.

 *

 * A timer task schedules the tasklet once per second just to make

 * sure it doesn't freeze up and to allow for bad reads to time out.

 * Building an adaptor to DE9 / DB25 RS232

 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 *

 * DISCLAIMER: Use this description AT YOUR OWN RISK! I'll not pay for

 * anything if you break your mouse, your computer or whatever!

 *

 * In theory, this mouse is a simple RS232 device. In practice, it has got

 * a quite uncommon plug and the requirement to additionally get a power

 * supply at +5V and -12V.

 *

 * If you look at the socket/jack (_not_ at the plug), we use this pin

 * numbering:

 *    _______

 *   / 7 6 5 \

 *  | 4 --- 3 |

 *   \  2 1  /

 *    -------

 *

 *	DEC socket	DE9	DB25	Note

 *	1 (GND)		5	7	-

 *	2 (RxD)		2	3	-

 *	3 (TxD)		3	2	-

 *	4 (-12V)	-	-	Somewhere from the PSU. At ATX, it's

 *					the thin blue wire at pin 12 of the

 *					ATX power connector. Only required for

 *					VSXXX-AA/-GA mice.

 *	5 (+5V)		-	-	PSU (red wires of ATX power connector

 *					on pin 4, 6, 19 or 20) or HDD power

 *					connector (also red wire).

 *	6 (+12V)	-	-	HDD power connector, yellow wire. Only

 *					required for VSXXX-AB digitizer.

 *	7 (dev. avail.)	-	-	The mouse shorts this one to pin 1.

 *					This way, the host computer can detect

 *					the mouse. To use it with the adaptor,

 *					simply don't connect this pin.

 *

 * So to get a working adaptor, you need to connect the mouse with three

 * wires to a RS232 port and two or three additional wires for +5V, +12V and

 * -12V to the PSU.

 *

 * Flow specification for the link is 4800, 8o1.

 *

 * The mice and tablet are described in "VCB02 Video Subsystem - Technical

 * Manual", DEC EK-104AA-TM-001. You'll find it at MANX, a search engine

 * specific for DEC documentation. Try

/*

 * The Wellspring trackpad, like many recent Apple trackpads, share

 * the usb device with the keyboard. Since keyboards are usually

 * handled by the HID system, the device ends up being handled by two

 * modules. Setting up the device therefore becomes slightly

 * complicated. To enable multitouch features, a mode switch is

 * required, which is usually applied via the control interface of the

 * device.  It can be argued where this switch should take place. In

 * some drivers, like appletouch, the switch is made during

 * probe. However, the hid module may also alter the state of the

 * device, resulting in trackpad malfunction under certain

 * circumstances. To get around this problem, there is at least one

 * example that utilizes the USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME quirk in order to

 * receive a reset_resume request rather than the normal resume.

 * Since the implementation of reset_resume is equal to mode switch

 * plus start_traffic, it seems easier to always do the switch when

 * starting traffic on the device.

/*

 * The code below implements open/close and manual suspend/resume.

 * All functions may be called in random order.

 * We have no idea why this particular hardware bug occurs.  The touchpad

 * severely miscalibrated pad; attempting to use the touchpad while it's

 * spewing means the cursor will jump all over the place, and act "drunk".

 *

 * The packets that are spewed tend to all have deltas between -2 and 2, and

 * the cursor will move around without really going very far.  It will

 * tend to end up in the same location; if we tally up the changes over

 * 100 packets, we end up w/ a final delta of close to 0.  This happens

 * pretty regularly when the touchpad is spewing, and is pretty hard to

 * manually trigger (at least for *my* fingers).  So, it makes a perfect

 * scheme for detecting spews.

 *

 *  ChangeLog:

 *      v0.1 - Initial release

 *      v0.2 - Hack to get around fake event 28's. (Bryan W. Headley)

 *      v0.3 - Make URB dynamic (Bryan W. Headley, Jun-8-2002)

 *             Released to Linux 2.4.19 and 2.5.x

 *      v0.4 - Rewrote substantial portions of the code to deal with

 *             corrected control sequences, timing, dynamic configuration,

 *             support of 6000U - 12000U, procfs, and macro key support

 *             (Jan-1-2003 - Feb-5-2003, Bryan W. Headley)

 *      v1.0 - Added support for diagnostic messages, count of messages

 *             received from URB - Mar-8-2003, Bryan W. Headley

 *      v1.1 - added support for tablet resolution, changed DV and proximity

 *             some corrections - Jun-22-2003, martin schneebacher

 *           - Added support for the sysfs interface, deprecating the

 *             procfs interface for 2.5.x kernel. Also added support for

 *             Wheel command. Bryan W. Headley July-15-2003.

 *      v1.2 - Reworked jitter timer as a kernel thread.

 *             Bryan W. Headley November-28-2003/Jan-10-2004.

 *      v1.3 - Repaired issue of kernel thread going nuts on single-processor

 *             machines, introduced programmableDelay as a command line

 *             parameter. Feb 7 2004, Bryan W. Headley.

 *      v1.4 - Re-wire jitter so it does not require a thread. Courtesy of

 *             Rene van Paassen. Added reporting of physical pointer device

 *             (e.g., stylus, mouse in reports 2, 3, 4, 5. We don't know

 *             for reports 1, 6.)

 *             what physical device reports for reports 1, 6.) Also enabled

 *             MOUSE and LENS tool button modes. Renamed "rubber" to "eraser".

 *             Feb 20, 2004, Bryan W. Headley.

 *      v1.5 - Added previousJitterable, so we don't do jitter delay when the

 *             user is holding a button down for periods of time.

 *

 * NOTE:

 *      This kernel driver is augmented by the "Aiptek" XFree86 input

 *      driver for your X server, as well as the Gaiptek GUI Front-end

 *      "Tablet Manager".

 *      These three products are highly interactive with one another,

 *      so therefore it's easier to document them all as one subsystem.

 *      Please visit the project's "home page", located at,

 *      http://aiptektablet.sourceforge.net.

 * aiptek_irq can receive one of six potential reports.

 * The documentation for each is in the body of the function.

 *

 * The tablet reports on several attributes per invocation of

 * aiptek_irq. Because the Linux Input Event system allows the

 * transmission of ONE attribute per input_report_xxx() call,

 * collation has to be done on the other end to reconstitute

 * a complete tablet report. Further, the number of Input Event reports

 * submitted varies, depending on what USB report type, and circumstance.

 * To deal with this, EV_MSC is used to indicate an 'end-of-report'

 * message. This has been an undocumented convention understood by the kernel

 * tablet driver and clients such as gpm and XFree86's tablet drivers.

 *

 * Of the information received from the tablet, the one piece I

 * cannot transmit is the proximity bit (without resorting to an EV_MSC

 * convention above.) I therefore have taken over REL_MISC and ABS_MISC

 * (for relative and absolute reports, respectively) for communicating

 * Proximity. Why two events? I thought it interesting to know if the

 * Proximity event occurred while the tablet was in absolute or relative

 * mode.

 * Update: REL_MISC proved not to be such a good idea. With REL_MISC you

 * get an event transmitted each time. ABS_MISC works better, since it

 * can be set and re-set. Thus, only using ABS_MISC from now on.

 *

 * Other tablets use the notion of a certain minimum stylus pressure

 * to infer proximity. While that could have been done, that is yet

 * another 'by convention' behavior, the documentation for which

 * would be spread between two (or more) pieces of software.

 *

 * EV_MSC usage was terminated for this purpose in Linux 2.5.x, and

 * replaced with the input_sync() method (which emits EV_SYN.)

	/*

	 * We should not only use 'host->max_busy_timeout' as the limitation

	 * when deciding the max discard sectors. We should set a balance value

	 * Here we set 'card->pref_erase' as the minimal discard sectors no

	 * 'host->max_busy_timeout' is large enough for more discard sectors,

	 * then we can continue to increase the max discard sectors until we

	 * get a balance value. In cases when the 'host->max_busy_timeout'

	 * isn't specified, use the default max erase timeout.

	/*

	 * When specifying a sector range to trim, chances are we might cross

	 * one erase-group.

	 * If we can only fit one erase-group in the controller timeout budget,

	 * we have to care that erase-group boundaries are not crossed by a
