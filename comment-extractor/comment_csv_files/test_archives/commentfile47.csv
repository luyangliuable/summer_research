 * LTC2952 (PowerPath) driver

 *

 * Copyright (C) 2014, Xsens Technologies BV <info@xsens.com>

 * Maintainer: René Moll <linux@r-moll.nl>

 *

 * ----------------------------------------

 * - Description

 * ----------------------------------------

 *

 * This driver is to be used with an external PowerPath Controller (LTC2952).

 * Its function is to determine when a external shut down is triggered

 * and react by properly shutting down the system.

 *

 * This driver expects a device tree with a ltc2952 entry for pin mapping.

 *

 * ----------------------------------------

 * - GPIO

 * ----------------------------------------

 *

 * The following GPIOs are used:

 * - trigger (input)

 *     A level change indicates the shut-down trigger. If it's state reverts

 *     within the time-out defined by trigger_delay, the shut down is not

 *     executed. If no pin is assigned to this input, the driver will start the

 *     watchdog toggle immediately. The chip will only power off the system if

 *     it is requested to do so through the kill line.

 *

 * - watchdog (output)

 *     Once a shut down is triggered, the driver will toggle this signal,

 *     with an internal (wde_interval) to stall the hardware shut down.

 *

 * - kill (output)

 *     The last action during shut down is triggering this signalling, such

 *     that the PowerPath Control will power down the hardware.

 *

 * ----------------------------------------

 * - Interrupts

 * ----------------------------------------

 *

 * The driver requires a non-shared, edge-triggered interrupt on the trigger

 * GPIO.

/*

 * This global variable is only needed for pm_power_off. We should

 * remove it entirely once we don't need the global state anymore.

/**

 * ltc2952_poweroff_timer_wde - Timer callback

 * Toggles the watchdog reset signal each wde_interval

 *

 * @timer: corresponding timer

 *

 * Returns HRTIMER_RESTART for an infinite loop which will only stop when the

 * machine actually shuts down

/**

 * ltc2952_poweroff_handler - Interrupt handler

 * Triggered each time the trigger signal changes state and (de)activates a

 * time-out (timer_trigger). Once the time-out is actually reached the shut

 * down is executed.

 *

 * @irq: IRQ number

 * @dev_id: pointer to the main data structure

 shutdown is already triggered, nothing to do any more */

		/*

		 * It's not a problem if the trigger gpio isn't available, but

		 * it is worth a warning if its use was defined in the device

		 * tree.

		/*

		 * Some things may have happened:

		 * - No trigger input was defined

		 * - Claiming the GPIO failed

		 * - We could not map to an IRQ

		 * - We couldn't register an interrupt handler

		 *

		 * None of these really are problems, but all of them

		 * disqualify the push button from controlling the power.

		 *

		 * It is therefore important to note that if the ltc2952

		 * detects a button press for long enough, it will still start

		 * its own powerdown window and cut the power on us if we don't

		 * start the watchdog trigger.

 * The HP Pavilion x2 10 series comes in a number of variants:

 * Bay Trail SoC    + AXP288 PMIC, Micro-USB, DMI_BOARD_NAME: "8021"

 * Bay Trail SoC    + AXP288 PMIC, Type-C,    DMI_BOARD_NAME: "815D"

 * Cherry Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC, Type-C,    DMI_BOARD_NAME: "813E"

 * Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC,     Type-C,    DMI_BOARD_NAME: "827C" or "82F4"

 *

 * The variants with the AXP288 + Type-C connector are all kinds of special:

 *

 * 1. They use a Type-C connector which the AXP288 does not support, so when

 * using a Type-C charger it is not recognized. Unlike most AXP288 devices,

 * this model actually has mostly working ACPI AC / Battery code, the ACPI code

 * "solves" this by simply setting the input_current_limit to 3A.

 * There are still some issues with the ACPI code, so we use this native driver,

 * and to solve the charging not working (500mA is not enough) issue we hardcode

 * the 3A input_current_limit like the ACPI code does.

 *

 * 2. If no charger is connected the machine boots with the vbus-path disabled.

 * Normally this is done when a 5V boost converter is active to avoid the PMIC

 * trying to charge from the 5V boost converter's output. This is done when

 * an OTG host cable is inserted and the ID pin on the micro-B receptacle is

 * pulled low and the ID pin has an ACPI event handler associated with it

 * which re-enables the vbus-path when the ID pin is pulled high when the

 * OTG host cable is removed. The Type-C connector has no ID pin, there is

 * no ID pin handler and there appears to be no 5V boost converter, so we

 * end up not charging because the vbus-path is disabled, until we unplug

 * the charger which automatically clears the vbus-path disable bit and then

 * on the second plug-in of the adapter we start charging. To solve the not

 * charging on first charger plugin we unconditionally enable the vbus-path at

 * probe on this model, which is safe since there is no 5V boost converter.

 *

 * Packet writing layer for ATAPI and SCSI CD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RW and

 * DVD-RAM devices.

 *

 * Theory of operation:

 *

 * At the lowest level, there is the standard driver for the CD/DVD device,

 * typically ide-cd.c or sr.c. This driver can handle read and write requests,

 * but it doesn't know anything about the special restrictions that apply to

 * packet writing. One restriction is that write requests must be aligned to

 * packet boundaries on the physical media, and the size of a write request

 * must be equal to the packet size. Another restriction is that a

 * GPCMD_FLUSH_CACHE command has to be issued to the drive before a read

 * command, if the previous command was a write.

 *

 * The purpose of the packet writing driver is to hide these restrictions from

 * higher layers, such as file systems, and present a block device that can be

 * randomly read and written using 2kB-sized blocks.

 *

 * The lowest layer in the packet writing driver is the packet I/O scheduler.

 * Its data is defined by the struct packet_iosched and includes two bio

 * queues with pending read and write requests. These queues are processed

 * by the pkt_iosched_process_queue() function. The write requests in this

 * queue are already properly aligned and sized. This layer is responsible for

 * issuing the flush cache commands and scheduling the I/O in a good order.

 *

 * The next layer transforms unaligned write requests to aligned writes. This

 * transformation requires reading missing pieces of data from the underlying

 * block device, assembling the pieces to full packets and queuing them to the

 * packet I/O scheduler.

 *

 * At the top layer there is a custom ->submit_bio function that forwards

 * read requests directly to the iosched queue and puts write requests in the

 * unaligned write queue. A kernel thread performs the necessary read

 * gathering to convert the unaligned writes to aligned writes and then feeds

 * them to the packet I/O scheduler.

 *  Copyright (C) 1993  Greg Harp

 *  Portions of this driver are based on code contributed by Brad Pepers

 *  

 *  revised 28.5.95 by Joerg Dorchain

 *  - now no bugs(?) any more for both HD & DD

 *  - added support for 40 Track 5.25" drives, 80-track hopefully behaves

 *    like 3.5" dd (no way to test - are there any 5.25" drives out there

 *    that work on an A4000?)

 *  - wrote formatting routine (maybe dirty, but works)

 *

 *  june/july 1995 added ms-dos support by Joerg Dorchain

 *  (portions based on messydos.device and various contributors)

 *  - currently only 9 and 18 sector disks

 *

 *  - fixed a bug with the internal trackbuffer when using multiple 

 *    disks the same time

 *  - made formatting a bit safer

 *  - added command line and machine based default for "silent" df0

 *

 *  december 1995 adapted for 1.2.13pl4 by Joerg Dorchain

 *  - works but I think it's inefficient. (look in redo_fd_request)

 *    But the changes were very efficient. (only three and a half lines)

 *

 *  january 1996 added special ioctl for tracking down read/write problems

 *  - usage ioctl(d, RAW_TRACK, ptr); the raw track buffer (MFM-encoded data

 *    is copied to area. (area should be large enough since no checking is

 *    done - 30K is currently sufficient). return the actual size of the

 *    trackbuffer

 *  - replaced udelays() by a timer (CIAA timer B) for the waits 

 *    needed for the disk mechanic.

 *

 *  february 1996 fixed error recovery and multiple disk access

 *  - both got broken the first time I tampered with the driver :-(

 *  - still not safe, but better than before

 *

 *  revised Marts 3rd, 1996 by Jes Sorensen for use in the 1.3.28 kernel.

 *  - Minor changes to accept the kdev_t.

 *  - Replaced some more udelays with ms_delays. Udelay is just a loop,

 *    and so the delay will be different depending on the given

 *    processor :-(

 *  - The driver could use a major cleanup because of the new

 *    major/minor handling that came with kdev_t. It seems to work for

 *    the time being, but I can't guarantee that it will stay like

 *    that when we start using 16 (24?) bit minors.

 *

 * restructured jan 1997 by Joerg Dorchain

 * - Fixed Bug accessing multiple disks

 * - some code cleanup

 * - added trackbuffer for each drive to speed things up

 * - fixed some race conditions (who finds the next may send it to me ;-)

 crc routines are borrowed from the messydos-handler  */

/* excerpt from the messydos-device           

; The CRC is computed not only over the actual data, but including

; the SYNC mark (3 * $a1) and the 'ID/DATA - Address Mark' ($fe/$fb).

; As we don't read or encode these fields into our buffers, we have to

; preload the registers containing the CRC with the values they would have

; after stepping over these fields.

;

; How CRCs "really" work:

;

; First, you should regard a bitstring as a series of coefficients of

; polynomials. We calculate with these polynomials in modulo-2

; arithmetic, in which both add and subtract are done the same as

; exclusive-or. Now, we modify our data (a very long polynomial) in

; such a way that it becomes divisible by the CCITT-standard 16-bit

;		 16   12   5

; polynomial:	x  + x	+ x + 1, represented by $11021. The easiest

; way to do this would be to multiply (using proper arithmetic) our

; datablock with $11021. So we have:

;   data * $11021		 =

;   data * ($10000 + $1021)      =

;   data * $10000 + data * $1021

; The left part of this is simple: Just add two 0 bytes. But then

; the right part (data $1021) remains difficult and even could have

; a carry into the left part. The solution is to use a modified

; multiplication, which has a result that is not correct, but with

; a difference of any multiple of $11021. We then only need to keep

; the 16 least significant bits of the result.

;

; The following algorithm does this for us:

;

;   unsigned char *data, c, crclo, crchi;

;   while (not done) {

;	c = *data++ + crchi;

;	crchi = (@ c) >> 8 + crclo;

;	crclo = @ c;

;   }

;

; Remember, + is done with EOR, the @ operator is in two tables (high

; and low byte separately), which is calculated as

;

;      $1021 * (c & $F0)

;  xor $1021 * (c & $0F)

;  xor $1021 * (c >> 4)         (* is regular multiplication)

;

;

; Anyway, the end result is the same as the remainder of the division of

; the data by $11021. I am afraid I need to study theory a bit more...

 * Modifications for ``Sector Shifting'' by Rob Hooft (hooft@chem.ruu.nl)

 * Christoph H. Hochst\"atter.

 * I have fixed the shift values to the ones I always use. Maybe a new

/*

 * 1994/8/8 -- Alain Knaff -- Switched to fdpatch driver: Support for bigger

 * drives are "upside-down").

 * Bit 0 of 'stretch' tells if the tracks need to be doubled for some

 * types (e.g. 360kB diskette in 1.2MB drive, etc.).  Bit 1 of 'stretch'

 * tells if the disk is in Commodore 1581 format, which means side 0 sectors

 * are located on side 1 of the disk but with a side 0 ID, and vice-versa.

 * This is the same as the Sharp MZ-80 5.25" CP/M disk format, except that the

 * 1581's logical side 0 is on physical side 1, whereas the Sharp's logical

 * side 0 is on physical side 0 (but with the misnamed sector IDs).

 * 'stretch' should probably be renamed to something more general, like

 * 'options'.

 *

 * Bits 2 through 9 of 'stretch' tell the number of the first sector.

 * The LSB (bit 2) is flipped. For most disks, the first sector

 * is 1 (represented by 0x00<<2).  For some CP/M and music sampler

 * disks (such as Ensoniq EPS 16plus) it is 0 (represented as 0x01<<2).

 * For Amstrad CPC disks it is 0xC1 (represented as 0xC0<<2).

 *

 * Other parameters should be self-explanatory (see also setfdprm(8)).

 * This routine is responsible for maintaining the FD_DISK_CHANGE flag,

 * and the last_checked date.

 *

 * last_checked is the date of the last check which showed 'no disk change'

 * FD_DISK_CHANGE is set under two conditions:

 * 1. The floppy has been changed after some i/o to that floppy already

 *    took place.

 * 2. No floppy disk is in the drive. This is done in order to ensure that

 *    requests are quickly flushed in case there is no disk in the drive. It

 *    follows that FD_DISK_CHANGE can only be cleared if there is a disk in

 *    the drive.

 *

 * For 1., maxblock is observed. Maxblock is 0 if no i/o has taken place yet.

 * For 2., FD_DISK_NEWCHANGE is watched. FD_DISK_NEWCHANGE is cleared on

 *  each seek. If a disk is present, the disk change line should also be

 *  cleared on each seek. Thus, if FD_DISK_NEWCHANGE is clear, but the disk

 *  change line is set, this means either that no disk is in the drive, or

 *  that it has been removed since the last seek.

 *

 * This means that we really have a third possibility too:

 * An rbd image specification.

 *

 * The tuple (pool_id, image_id, snap_id) is sufficient to uniquely

 * identify an image.  Each rbd_dev structure includes a pointer to

 * an rbd_spec structure that encapsulates this identity.

 *

 * Each of the id's in an rbd_spec has an associated name.  For a

 * user-mapped image, the names are supplied and the id's associated

 * with them are looked up.  For a layered image, a parent image is

 * defined by the tuple, and the names are looked up.

 *

 * An rbd_dev structure contains a parent_spec pointer which is

 * non-null if the image it represents is a child in a layered

 * image.  This pointer will refer to the rbd_spec structure used

 * by the parent rbd_dev for its own identity (i.e., the structure

 * is shared between the parent and child).

 *

 * Since these structures are populated once, during the discovery

 * phase of image construction, they are effectively immutable so

 * we make no effort to synchronize access to them.

 *

 * Note that code herein does not assume the image name is known (it

 * could be a null pointer).

 *

 *  Big cleanup Sep 11..14 1994 Roman Hodek:

 *   - Driver now works interrupt driven

 *   - Support for two drives; should work, but I cannot test that :-(

 *   - Reading is done in whole tracks and buffered to speed up things

 *   - Disk change detection and drive deselecting after motor-off

 *     similar to TOS

 *   - Autodetection of disk format (DD/HD); untested yet, because I

 *     don't have an HD drive :-(

 *

 *  Fixes Nov 13 1994 Martin Schaller:

 *   - Autodetection works now

 *   - Support for 5 1/4'' disks

 *   - Removed drive type (unknown on atari)

 *   - Do seeks with 8 Mhz

 *

 *  Changes by Andreas Schwab:

 *   - After errors in multiple read mode try again reading single sectors

 *  (Feb 1995):

 *   - Clean up error handling

 *   - Set blk_size for proper size checking

 *   - Initialize track register when testing presence of floppy

 *   - Implement some ioctl's

 *

 *  Changes by Torsten Lang:

 *   - When probing the floppies we should add the FDCCMDADD_H flag since

 *     the FDC will otherwise wait forever when no disk is inserted...

 *

 * ++ Freddi Aschwanden (fa) 20.9.95 fixes for medusa:

 *  - MFPDELAY() after each FDC access -> atari 

 *  - more/other disk formats

 *  - DMA to the block buffer directly if we have a 32bit DMA

 *  - for medusa, the step rate is always 3ms

 *  - on medusa, use only cache_push()

 * Roman:

 *  - Make disk format numbering independent from minors

 *  - Let user set max. supported drive type (speeds up format

 *    detection, saves buffer space)

 *

 * Roman 10/15/95:

 *  - implement some more ioctls

 *  - disk formatting

 *  

 * Andreas 95/12/12:

 *  - increase gap size at start of track for HD/ED disks

 *

 * Michael (MSch) 11/07/96:

 *  - implemented FDSETPRM and FDDEFPRM ioctl

 *

 * Andreas (97/03/19):

 *  - implemented missing BLK* ioctls

 *

 *  Things left to do:

 *   - Formatting

 *   - Maybe a better strategy for disk change detection (does anyone

 *     know one?)

/*

 * LIMITATIONS:

 * We want to support >= peta byte of backend storage, while for now still using

 * a granularity of one bit per 4KiB of storage.

 * 1 << 50		bytes backend storage (1 PiB)

 * 1 << (50 - 12)	bits needed

 *	38 --> we need u64 to index and count bits

 * 1 << (38 - 3)	bitmap bytes needed

 *	35 --> we still need u64 to index and count bytes

 *			(that's 32 GiB of bitmap for 1 PiB storage)

 * 1 << (35 - 2)	32bit longs needed

 *	33 --> we'd even need u64 to index and count 32bit long words.

 * 1 << (35 - 3)	64bit longs needed

 *	32 --> we could get away with a 32bit unsigned int to index and count

 *	64bit long words, but I rather stay with unsigned long for now.

 *	We probably should neither count nor point to bytes or long words

 *	directly, but either by bitnumber, or by page index and offset.

 * 1 << (35 - 12)

 *	22 --> we need that much 4KiB pages of bitmap.

 *	1 << (22 + 3) --> on a 64bit arch,

 *	we need 32 MiB to store the array of page pointers.

 *

 * Because I'm lazy, and because the resulting patch was too large, too ugly

 * and still incomplete, on 32bit we still "only" support 16 TiB (minus some),

 * (1 << 32) bits * 4k storage.

 *



 * bitmap storage and IO:

 *	Bitmap is stored little endian on disk, and is kept little endian in

 *	core memory. Currently we still hold the full bitmap in core as long

 *	as we are "attached" to a local disk, which at 32 GiB for 1PiB storage

 *	seems excessive.

 *

 *	We plan to reduce the amount of in-core bitmap pages by paging them in

 *	and out against their on-disk location as necessary, but need to make

 *	sure we don't cause too much meta data IO, and must not deadlock in

 *	tight memory situations. This needs some more work.

/*

 * NOTE

 *  Access to the *bm_pages is protected by bm_lock.

 *  It is safe to read the other members within the lock.

                          Under the terms of the GNU General Public License.



        This is the high-level driver for parallel port ATAPI tape

        drives based on chips supported by the paride module.



	The driver implements both rewinding and non-rewinding

	devices, filemarks, and the rewind ioctl.  It allocates

	a small internal "bounce buffer" for each open device, but

        otherwise expects buffering and blocking to be done at the

        user level.  As with most block-structured tapes, short

	writes are padded to full tape blocks, so reading back a file

        may return more data than was actually written.



        By default, the driver will autoprobe for a single parallel

        port ATAPI tape drive, but if their individual parameters are

        specified, the driver can handle up to 4 drives.



	The rewinding devices are named /dev/pt0, /dev/pt1, ...

	while the non-rewinding devices are /dev/npt0, /dev/npt1, etc.



        The behaviour of the pt driver can be altered by setting

        some parameters from the insmod command line.  The following

        parameters are adjustable:



            drive0      These four arguments can be arrays of       

            drive1      1-6 integers as follows:

            drive2

            drive3      <prt>,<pro>,<uni>,<mod>,<slv>,<dly>



                        Where,



                <prt>   is the base of the parallel port address for

                        the corresponding drive.  (required)



                <pro>   is the protocol number for the adapter that

                        supports this drive.  These numbers are

                        logged by 'paride' when the protocol modules

                        are initialised.  (0 if not given)



                <uni>   for those adapters that support chained

                        devices, this is the unit selector for the

                        chain of devices on the given port.  It should

                        be zero for devices that don't support chaining.

                        (0 if not given)



                <mod>   this can be -1 to choose the best mode, or one

                        of the mode numbers supported by the adapter.

                        (-1 if not given)



                <slv>   ATAPI devices can be jumpered to master or slave.

                        Set this to 0 to choose the master drive, 1 to

                        choose the slave, -1 (the default) to choose the

                        first drive found.



                <dly>   some parallel ports require the driver to 

                        go more slowly.  -1 sets a default value that

                        should work with the chosen protocol.  Otherwise,

                        set this to a small integer, the larger it is

                        the slower the port i/o.  In some cases, setting

                        this to zero will speed up the device. (default -1)



	    major	You may use this parameter to override the

			default major number (96) that this driver

			will use.  Be sure to change the device

			name as well.



	    name	This parameter is a character string that

			contains the name the kernel will use for this

			device (in /proc output, for instance).

			(default "pt").



            verbose     This parameter controls the amount of logging

                        that the driver will do.  Set it to 0 for

                        normal operation, 1 to see autoprobe progress

                        messages, or 2 to see additional debugging

                        output.  (default 0)

 

        If this driver is built into the kernel, you can use 

        the following command line parameters, with the same values

        as the corresponding module parameters listed above:



            pt.drive0

            pt.drive1

            pt.drive2

            pt.drive3



        In addition, you can use the parameter pt.disable to disable

        the driver entirely.

	The pg driver provides a simple character device interface for

	sending ATAPI commands to a device.  With the exception of the

	ATAPI reset operation, all operations are performed by a pair

	of read and write operations to the appropriate /dev/pgN device.

	A write operation delivers a command and any outbound data in

	a single buffer.  Normally, the write will succeed unless the

	device is offline or malfunctioning, or there is already another

	command pending.  If the write succeeds, it should be followed

	immediately by a read operation, to obtain any returned data and

	status information.  A read will fail if there is no operation

	in progress.



	As a special case, the device can be reset with a write operation,

	and in this case, no following read is expected, or permitted.



	There are no ioctl() operations.  Any single operation

	may transfer at most PG_MAX_DATA bytes.  Note that the driver must

	copy the data through an internal buffer.  In keeping with all

	current ATAPI devices, command packets are assumed to be exactly

	12 bytes in length.



	To permit future changes to this interface, the headers in the

	read and write buffers contain a single character "magic" flag.

	Currently this flag must be the character "P".



	By default, the driver will autoprobe for a single parallel

	port ATAPI device, but if their individual parameters are

	specified, the driver can handle up to 4 devices.



	To use this device, you must have the following device 

	special files defined:



		/dev/pg0 c 97 0

		/dev/pg1 c 97 1

		/dev/pg2 c 97 2

		/dev/pg3 c 97 3



	(You'll need to change the 97 to something else if you use

	the 'major' parameter to install the driver on a different

	major number.)



	The behaviour of the pg driver can be altered by setting

	some parameters from the insmod command line.  The following

	parameters are adjustable:



	    drive0      These four arguments can be arrays of       

	    drive1      1-6 integers as follows:

	    drive2

	    drive3      <prt>,<pro>,<uni>,<mod>,<slv>,<dly>



			Where,



		<prt>   is the base of the parallel port address for

			the corresponding drive.  (required)



		<pro>   is the protocol number for the adapter that

			supports this drive.  These numbers are

			logged by 'paride' when the protocol modules

			are initialised.  (0 if not given)



		<uni>   for those adapters that support chained

			devices, this is the unit selector for the

			chain of devices on the given port.  It should

			be zero for devices that don't support chaining.

			(0 if not given)



		<mod>   this can be -1 to choose the best mode, or one

			of the mode numbers supported by the adapter.

			(-1 if not given)



		<slv>   ATAPI devices can be jumpered to master or slave.

			Set this to 0 to choose the master drive, 1 to

			choose the slave, -1 (the default) to choose the

			first drive found.



		<dly>   some parallel ports require the driver to 

			go more slowly.  -1 sets a default value that

			should work with the chosen protocol.  Otherwise,

			set this to a small integer, the larger it is

			the slower the port i/o.  In some cases, setting

			this to zero will speed up the device. (default -1)



	    major	You may use this parameter to override the

			default major number (97) that this driver

			will use.  Be sure to change the device

			name as well.



	    name	This parameter is a character string that

			contains the name the kernel will use for this

			device (in /proc output, for instance).

			(default "pg").



	    verbose     This parameter controls the amount of logging

			that is done by the driver.  Set it to 0 for 

			quiet operation, to 1 to enable progress

			messages while the driver probes for devices,

			or to 2 for full debug logging.  (default 0)



	If this driver is built into the kernel, you can use 

	the following command line parameters, with the same values

	as the corresponding module parameters listed above:



	    pg.drive0

	    pg.drive1

	    pg.drive2

	    pg.drive3



	In addition, you can use the parameter pg.disable to disable

	the driver entirely.

        This is a low-level driver for the KBIC-951A and KBIC-971A

        the 951A, so this driver registers itself twice, once for

	each chip.

	Freecom uses this adapter in a battery powered external

        This is the high-level driver for parallel port ATAPI disk

        drives based on chips supported by the paride module.



        By default, the driver will autoprobe for a single parallel

        port ATAPI disk drive, but if their individual parameters are

        specified, the driver can handle up to 4 drives.



        The behaviour of the pf driver can be altered by setting

        some parameters from the insmod command line.  The following

        parameters are adjustable:



            drive0      These four arguments can be arrays of       

            drive1      1-7 integers as follows:

            drive2

            drive3      <prt>,<pro>,<uni>,<mod>,<slv>,<lun>,<dly>



                        Where,



                <prt>   is the base of the parallel port address for

                        the corresponding drive.  (required)



                <pro>   is the protocol number for the adapter that

                        supports this drive.  These numbers are

                        logged by 'paride' when the protocol modules

                        are initialised.  (0 if not given)



                <uni>   for those adapters that support chained

                        devices, this is the unit selector for the

                        chain of devices on the given port.  It should

                        be zero for devices that don't support chaining.

                        (0 if not given)



                <mod>   this can be -1 to choose the best mode, or one

                        of the mode numbers supported by the adapter.

                        (-1 if not given)



                <slv>   ATAPI CDroms can be jumpered to master or slave.

                        Set this to 0 to choose the master drive, 1 to

                        choose the slave, -1 (the default) to choose the

                        first drive found.



		<lun>   Some ATAPI devices support multiple LUNs.

                        One example is the ATAPI PD/CD drive from

                        Matshita/Panasonic.  This device has a 

                        CD drive on LUN 0 and a PD drive on LUN 1.

                        By default, the driver will search for the

                        first LUN with a supported device.  Set 

                        this parameter to force it to use a specific

                        LUN.  (default -1)



                <dly>   some parallel ports require the driver to 

                        go more slowly.  -1 sets a default value that

                        should work with the chosen protocol.  Otherwise,

                        set this to a small integer, the larger it is

                        the slower the port i/o.  In some cases, setting

                        this to zero will speed up the device. (default -1)



	    major	You may use this parameter to override the

			default major number (47) that this driver

			will use.  Be sure to change the device

			name as well.



	    name	This parameter is a character string that

			contains the name the kernel will use for this

			device (in /proc output, for instance).

			(default "pf").



            cluster     The driver will attempt to aggregate requests

                        for adjacent blocks into larger multi-block

                        clusters.  The maximum cluster size (in 512

                        byte sectors) is set with this parameter.

                        (default 64)



            verbose     This parameter controls the amount of logging

                        that the driver will do.  Set it to 0 for

                        normal operation, 1 to see autoprobe progress

                        messages, or 2 to see additional debugging

                        output.  (default 0)

 

	    nice        This parameter controls the driver's use of

			idle CPU time, at the expense of some speed.



        If this driver is built into the kernel, you can use the

        following command line parameters, with the same values

        as the corresponding module parameters listed above:



            pf.drive0

            pf.drive1

            pf.drive2

            pf.drive3

	    pf.cluster

            pf.nice



        In addition, you can use the parameter pf.disable to disable

        the driver entirely.

		        of the mode numbers supported by the adapter.

			(-1 if not given)



		<geo>   this defaults to 0 to indicate that the driver

	This is a high-level driver for parallel port ATAPI CD-ROM

        drives based on chips supported by the paride module.



        By default, the driver will autoprobe for a single parallel

        port ATAPI CD-ROM drive, but if their individual parameters are

        specified, the driver can handle up to 4 drives.



        The behaviour of the pcd driver can be altered by setting

        some parameters from the insmod command line.  The following

        parameters are adjustable:



            drive0      These four arguments can be arrays of       

            drive1      1-6 integers as follows:

            drive2

            drive3      <prt>,<pro>,<uni>,<mod>,<slv>,<dly>



                        Where,



                <prt>   is the base of the parallel port address for

                        the corresponding drive.  (required)



                <pro>   is the protocol number for the adapter that

                        supports this drive.  These numbers are

                        logged by 'paride' when the protocol modules

                        are initialised.  (0 if not given)



                <uni>   for those adapters that support chained

                        devices, this is the unit selector for the

                        chain of devices on the given port.  It should

                        be zero for devices that don't support chaining.

                        (0 if not given)



                <mod>   this can be -1 to choose the best mode, or one

                        of the mode numbers supported by the adapter.

                        (-1 if not given)



		<slv>   ATAPI CD-ROMs can be jumpered to master or slave.

			Set this to 0 to choose the master drive, 1 to

                        choose the slave, -1 (the default) to choose the

			first drive found.



                <dly>   some parallel ports require the driver to 

                        go more slowly.  -1 sets a default value that

                        should work with the chosen protocol.  Otherwise,

                        set this to a small integer, the larger it is

                        the slower the port i/o.  In some cases, setting

                        this to zero will speed up the device. (default -1)

                        

            major       You may use this parameter to override the

                        default major number (46) that this driver

                        will use.  Be sure to change the device

                        name as well.



            name        This parameter is a character string that

                        contains the name the kernel will use for this

                        device (in /proc output, for instance).

                        (default "pcd")



            verbose     This parameter controls the amount of logging

                        that the driver will do.  Set it to 0 for

                        normal operation, 1 to see autoprobe progress

                        messages, or 2 to see additional debugging

                        output.  (default 0)

  

            nice        This parameter controls the driver's use of

                        idle CPU time, at the expense of some speed.

 

	If this driver is built into the kernel, you can use the

        following kernel command line parameters, with the same values

        as the corresponding module parameters listed above:



	    pcd.drive0

	    pcd.drive1

	    pcd.drive2

	    pcd.drive3

	    pcd.nice



        In addition, you can use the parameter pcd.disable to disable

        the driver entirely.

 * rnbd_rerun_all_if_idle() - rerun all queues left in the list if

 * Description:

 *     This function tries to rerun all stopped queues if there are no

 *     requests in-flight anymore.  This function tries to solve an obvious

 *     problem, when number of tags < than number of queues (hctx), which

 *     are stopped and put to sleep.  If last permit, which has been just put,

 *     does not wake up all left queues (hctxs), IO requests hang forever.

 *

 *     That can happen when all number of permits, say N, have been exhausted

 *     from one CPU, and we have many block devices per session, say M.

 *     Each block device has it's own queue (hctx) for each CPU, so eventually

 *     we can put that number of queues (hctxs) to sleep: M x nr_cpu_ids.

 *     If number of permits N < M x nr_cpu_ids finally we will get an IO hang.

 *

 *     To avoid this hang last caller of rnbd_put_permit() (last caller is the

 *     one who observes sess->busy == 0) must wake up all remaining queues.

 *

 * Context:

 *     Does not matter.

		/* We have a subtle rare case here, when all permits can be

		 * consumed before busy counter increased.  This is safe,

		 * because loser will get NULL as a permit, observe 0 busy

		 * counter and immediately restart the queue himself.

	/* Paired with rnbd_clt_dev_add_to_requeue().  Decrement first

	 * and then check queue bits.

	/*

	 * 1st reference is dropped after finishing sending a "user" message,

	 * 2nd reference is dropped after confirmation with the response is

	 * returned.

	 * 1st and 2nd can happen in any order, so the rnbd_iu should be

	 * released (rtrs_permit returned to rtrs) only after both

	 * are finished.

			/*

			 * If server thinks its fine, but we fail to process

			 * then be nice and send a close to server.

		/*

		 * That can happen only in one case, when RTRS has restablished

		 * the connection and link_ev() is called, but session is almost

		 * dead, last reference on session is put and caller is waiting

		 * for RTRS to close everything.

	/*

	 * Careful here: we are called from RTRS link event directly,

	 * thus we can't send any RTRS request and wait for response

	 * or RTRS will not be able to complete request with failure

	 * if something goes wrong (failing of outstanding requests

	 * happens exactly from the context where we are blocking now).

	 *

	 * So to avoid deadlocks each usr message sent from here must

	 * be asynchronous.

			/*

			 * When device is establishing connection for the first

			 * time - do not remap, it will be closed soon.

 *

 * Kill-line thanks to John T Kohl, who also corrected VMIN = VTIME = 0.

 *

 * Modified by Theodore Ts'o, 9/14/92, to dynamically allocate the

 * tty_struct and tty_queue structures.  Previously there was an array

 * of 256 tty_struct's which was statically allocated, and the

 * tty_queue structures were allocated at boot time.  Both are now

 * dynamically allocated only when the tty is open.

 *

 * Also restructured routines so that there is more of a separation

 * between the high-level tty routines (tty_io.c and tty_ioctl.c) and

 * the low-level tty routines (serial.c, pty.c, console.c).  This

 * makes for cleaner and more compact code.  -TYT, 9/17/92

 *

 * Modified by Fred N. van Kempen, 01/29/93, to add line disciplines

 * discipline handling modules (like SLIP).

 *

 * NOTE: pay no attention to the line discipline code (yet); its

 * interface is still subject to change in this version...

/* generic HDLC line discipline for Linux

 *

 * Written by Paul Fulghum paulkf@microgate.com

 *

 * Adapted from ppp.c, written by Michael Callahan <callahan@maths.ox.ac.uk>,

 *

 * Original release 01/11/99

 *

 * This module implements the tty line discipline N_HDLC for use with

 * tty device drivers that support bit-synchronous HDLC communications.

 *

 * All HDLC data is frame oriented which means:

 *

 * 1. tty write calls represent one complete transmit frame of data

 *    The device driver should accept the complete frame or none of

 *    the frame (busy) in the write method. Each write call should have

 *    a byte count in the range of 2-65535 bytes (2 is min HDLC frame

 *    with 1 addr byte and 1 ctrl byte). The max byte count of 65535

 *    should include any crc bytes required. For example, when using

 *    CCITT CRC32, 4 crc bytes are required, so the maximum size frame

 *    the application may transmit is limited to 65531 bytes. For CCITT

 *    CRC16, the maximum application frame size would be 65533.

 *

 *

 * 2. receive callbacks from the device driver represents

 *    one received frame. The device driver should bypass

 *    the tty flip buffer and call the line discipline receive

 *    callback directly to avoid fragmenting or concatenating

 *    multiple frames into a single receive callback.

 *

 *    The HDLC line discipline queues the receive frames in separate

 *    buffers so complete receive frames can be returned by the

 *    tty read calls.

 *

 * 3. tty read calls returns an entire frame of data or nothing.

 *

 * 4. all send and receive data is considered raw. No processing

 *    or translation is performed by the line discipline, regardless

 *    of the tty flags

 *

 * 5. When line discipline is queried for the amount of receive

 *    data available (FIOC), 0 is returned if no data available,

 *    otherwise the count of the next available frame is returned.

 *    (instead of the sum of all received frame counts).

 *

 * These conventions allow the standard tty programming interface

 * to be used for synchronous HDLC applications when used with

 * this line discipline (or another line discipline that is frame

 * oriented such as N_PPP).

 *

 * The SyncLink driver (synclink.c) implements both asynchronous

 * (using standard line discipline N_TTY) and synchronous HDLC

 * (using N_HDLC) communications, with the latter using the above

 * conventions.

 *

 * This implementation is very basic and does not maintain

 * any statistics. The main point is to enforce the raw data

 * and frame orientation of HDLC communications.

 *

 * This driver support three distinct interfaces, all of which are related to

 *

 * 1) An early-console (udbg) driver.  This provides early console output

 * through a byte channel.  The byte channel handle must be specified in a

 *

 * 2) A normal console driver.  Output is sent to the byte channel designated

 * for stdout in the device tree.  The console driver is for handling kernel

 * printk calls.

 *

 * 3) A tty driver, which is used to handle user-space input and output.  The

 * byte channel used for the console is designated as the default tty.

*************************** SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ****************************/

/*

 * Enable the transmit interrupt

 *

 * Unlike a serial device, byte channels have no mechanism for disabling their

 * own receive or transmit interrupts.  To emulate that feature, we toggle

 * the IRQ in the kernel.

 *

 * We cannot just blindly call enable_irq() or disable_irq(), because these

 * calls are reference counted.  This means that we cannot call enable_irq()

 * if interrupts are already enabled.  This can happen in two situations:

 *

 * 1. The tty layer makes two back-to-back calls to ehv_bc_tty_write()

 * 2. A transmit interrupt occurs while executing ehv_bc_tx_dequeue()

 *

 * To work around this, we keep a flag to tell us if the IRQ is enabled or not.

/*

 * find the byte channel handle to use for the console

 *

 * The byte channel to be used for the console is specified via a "stdout"

 * property in the /chosen node.

	/* We don't care what the aliased node is actually called.  We only

	 * care if it's compatible with "epapr,hv-byte-channel", because that

	 * indicates that it's a byte channel node.

	/*

	 * The 'hv-handle' property contains the handle for this byte channel.

************************** EARLY CONSOLE DRIVER ***************************/

/*

 * send a byte to a byte channel, wait if necessary

 *

 * This function sends a byte to a byte channel, and it waits and

 * retries if the byte channel is full.  It returns if the character

 * has been sent, or if some error has occurred.

 *

/*

 * The udbg subsystem calls this function to display a single character.

 * We convert CR to a CR/LF.

/*

 * early console initialization

 *

 * PowerPC kernels support an early printk console, also known as udbg.

 * This function must be called via the ppc_md.init_early function pointer.

 * At this point, the device tree has been unflattened, so we can obtain the

 * byte channel handle for stdout.

 *

 * We only support displaying of characters (putc).  We do not support

 * keyboard input.

/*

 * write a string to the console

 *

 * This function gets called to write a string from the kernel, typically from

 * a printk().  This function spins until all data is written.

 *

 * We copy the data to a temporary buffer because we need to insert a \r in

 * front of every \n.  It's more efficient to copy the data to the buffer than

 * it is to make multiple hcalls for each character or each newline.

/*

 * byte channel receive interrupt handler

 *

 * This ISR is called whenever data is available on a byte channel.

	/* Find out how much data needs to be read, and then ask the TTY layer

	 * if it can handle that much.  We want to ensure that every byte we

	 * read from the byte channel will be accepted by the TTY layer.

	/* 'count' is the maximum amount of data the TTY layer can accept at

	 * this time.  However, during testing, I was never able to get 'count'

	 * to be less than 'rx_count'.  I'm not sure whether I'm calling it

	 * correctly.

		/* Read some data from the byte channel.  This function will

		 * never return more than EV_BYTE_CHANNEL_MAX_BYTES bytes.

		/* 'len' is now the amount of data that's been received. 'len'

		 * can't be zero, and most likely it's equal to one.

		/* 'ret' is the number of bytes that the TTY layer accepted.

		 * If it's not equal to 'len', then it means the buffer is

		 * full, which should never happen.  If it does happen, we can

		 * exit gracefully, but we drop the last 'len - ret' characters

		 * that we read from the byte channel.

 Tell the tty layer that we're done. */

/*

 * dequeue the transmit buffer to the hypervisor

 *

 * This function, which can be called in interrupt context, dequeues as much

 * data as possible from the transmit buffer to the byte channel.

 'len' is valid only if the return code is 0 or EV_EAGAIN */

		/*

		 * If we haven't emptied the buffer, then enable the TX IRQ.

		 * We'll get an interrupt when there's more room in the

		 * hypervisor's output buffer.

/*

 * byte channel transmit interrupt handler

 *

 * This ISR is called whenever space becomes available for transmitting

 * characters on a byte channel.

/*

 * This function is called when the tty layer has data for us send.  We store

 * the data first in a circular buffer, and then dequeue as much of that data

 * as possible.

 *

 * We don't need to worry about whether there is enough room in the buffer for

 * all the data.  The purpose of ehv_bc_tty_write_room() is to tell the tty

 * layer how much data it can safely send to us.  We guarantee that

 * ehv_bc_tty_write_room() will never lie, so the tty layer will never send us

 * too much data.

/*

 * This function can be called multiple times for a given tty_struct, which is

 * why we initialize bc->ttys in ehv_bc_tty_port_activate() instead.

 *

 * The tty layer will still call this function even if the device was not

 * registered (i.e. tty_register_device() was not called).  This happens

 * because tty_register_device() is optional and some legacy drivers don't

 * use it.  So we need to check for that.

/*

 * Amazingly, if ehv_bc_tty_open() returns an error code, the tty layer will

 * still call this function to close the tty device.  So we can't assume that

 * the tty port has been initialized.

/*

 * Return the amount of space in the output buffer

 *

 * This is actually a contract between the driver and the tty layer outlining

 * how much write room the driver can guarantee will be sent OR BUFFERED.  This

 * driver MUST honor the return value.

/*

 * Stop sending data to the tty layer

 *

 * This function is called when the tty layer's input buffers are getting full,

 * so the driver should stop sending it data.  The easiest way to do this is to

 * disable the RX IRQ, which will prevent ehv_bc_tty_rx_isr() from being

 * called.

 *

 * The hypervisor will continue to queue up any incoming data.  If there is any

 * data in the queue when the RX interrupt is enabled, we'll immediately get an

 * RX interrupt.

/*

 * Resume sending data to the tty layer

 *

 * This function is called after previously calling ehv_bc_tty_throttle().  The

 * tty layer's input buffers now have more room, so the driver can resume

 * sending it data.

	/* If there is any data in the queue when the RX interrupt is enabled,

	 * we'll immediately get an RX interrupt.

/*

 * TTY driver operations

 *

 * If we could ask the hypervisor how much data is still in the TX buffer, or

 * at least how big the TX buffers are, then we could implement the

 * .wait_until_sent and .chars_in_buffer functions.

/*

 * initialize the TTY port

 *

 * This function will only be called once, no matter how many times

 * ehv_bc_tty_open() is called.  That's why we register the ISR here, and also

/**

 *	tty_chars_in_buffer	-	characters pending

 *	@tty: terminal

 *

 *	Return the number of bytes of data in the device private

 *	output queue. If no private method is supplied there is assumed

 *	to be no queue on the device.

/**

 *	tty_write_room		-	write queue space

 *	@tty: terminal

 *

 *	Return the number of bytes that can be queued to this device

 *	at the present time. The result should be treated as a guarantee

 *	and the driver cannot offer a value it later shrinks by more than

 *	the number of bytes written. If no method is provided 2K is always

 *	returned and data may be lost as there will be no flow control.

/**

 *	tty_driver_flush_buffer	-	discard internal buffer

 *	@tty: terminal

 *

 *	Discard the internal output buffer for this device. If no method

 *	is provided then either the buffer cannot be hardware flushed or

 *	there is no buffer driver side.

/**

 *	tty_unthrottle		-	flow control

 *	@tty: terminal

 *

 *	Indicate that a tty may continue transmitting data down the stack.

 *	Takes the termios rwsem to protect against parallel throttle/unthrottle

 *	and also to ensure the driver can consistently reference its own

 *	termios data at this point when implementing software flow control.

 *

 *	Drivers should however remember that the stack can issue a throttle,

 *	then change flow control method, then unthrottle.

/**

 *	tty_throttle_safe	-	flow control

 *	@tty: terminal

 *

 *	Indicate that a tty should stop transmitting data down the stack.

 *	tty_throttle_safe will only attempt throttle if tty->flow_change is

 *	TTY_THROTTLE_SAFE. Prevents an accidental throttle due to race

 *	conditions when throttling is conditional on factors evaluated prior to

 *	throttling.

 *

 *	Returns 0 if tty is throttled (or was already throttled)

/**

 *	tty_unthrottle_safe	-	flow control

 *	@tty: terminal

 *

 *	Similar to tty_unthrottle() but will only attempt unthrottle

 *	if tty->flow_change is TTY_UNTHROTTLE_SAFE. Prevents an accidental

 *	unthrottle due to race conditions when unthrottling is conditional

 *	on factors evaluated prior to unthrottling.

 *

 *	Returns 0 if tty is unthrottled (or was already unthrottled)

/**

 *	tty_wait_until_sent	-	wait for I/O to finish

 *	@tty: tty we are waiting for

 *	@timeout: how long we will wait

 *

 *	Wait for characters pending in a tty driver to hit the wire, or

 *	for a timeout to occur (eg due to flow control)

 *

 *	Locking: none

/**

 *	tty_get_char_size	-	get size of a character

 *	@cflag: termios cflag value

 *	Get the size (in bits) of a character depending on @cflag's %CSIZE

/**

 *	tty_get_frame_size	-	get size of a frame

 *	@cflag: termios cflag value

 *

 *	Get the size (in bits) of a frame depending on @cflag's %CSIZE, %CSTOPB,

/*

 *    Moxa Port Number Description:

 *

 *      MOXA serial driver supports up to 4 MOXA-C218/C320 boards. And,

 *      the port number using in MOXA driver functions will be 0 to 31 for

 *      first MOXA board, 32 to 63 for second, 64 to 95 for third and 96

 *      to 127 for fourth. For example, if you setup three MOXA boards,

 *      first board is C218, second board is C320-16 and third board is

 *      C320-32. The port number of first board (C218 - 8 ports) is from

 *      0 to 7. The port number of second board (C320 - 16 ports) is form

 *      32 to 47. The port number of third board (C320 - 32 ports) is from

 *      64 to 95. And those port numbers form 8 to 31, 48 to 63 and 96 to

 *      127 will be invalid.

 *

 * Author(s) :  Ryan S. Arnold <rsa@us.ibm.com>

 *

 * This is the device driver for the IBM Hypervisor Virtual Console Server,

 * "hvcs".  The IBM hvcs provides a tty driver interface to allow Linux

 * user space applications access to the system consoles of logically

 * partitioned operating systems, e.g. Linux, running on the same partitioned

 * Power5 ppc64 system.  Physical hardware consoles per partition are not

 * practical on this hardware so system consoles are accessed by this driver

 * using inter-partition firmware interfaces to virtual terminal devices.

 *

 * A vty is known to the HMC as a "virtual serial server adapter".  It is a

 * virtual terminal device that is created by firmware upon partition creation

 * to act as a partitioned OS's console device.

 *

 * Firmware dynamically (via hotplug) exposes vty-servers to a running ppc64

 * Linux system upon their creation by the HMC or their exposure during boot.

 * The non-user interactive backend of this driver is implemented as a vio

 * device driver so that it can receive notification of vty-server lifetimes

 * after it registers with the vio bus to handle vty-server probe and remove

 * callbacks.

 *

 * Many vty-servers can be configured to connect to one vty, but a vty can

 * only be actively connected to by a single vty-server, in any manner, at one

 * time.  If the HMC is currently hosting the console for a target Linux

 * partition; attempts to open the tty device to the partition's console using

 * the hvcs on any partition will return -EBUSY with every open attempt until

 * the HMC frees the connection between its vty-server and the desired

 * partition's vty device.  Conversely, a vty-server may only be connected to

 * a single vty at one time even though it may have several configured vty

 * partner possibilities.

 *

 * Firmware does not provide notification of vty partner changes to this

 * driver.  This means that an HMC Super Admin may add or remove partner vtys

 * from a vty-server's partner list but the changes will not be signaled to

 * the vty-server.  Firmware only notifies the driver when a vty-server is

 * added or removed from the system.  To compensate for this deficiency, this

 * driver implements a sysfs update attribute which provides a method for

 * rescanning partner information upon a user's request.

 *

 * Each vty-server, prior to being exposed to this driver is reference counted

/*

 * 1.3.0 -> 1.3.1 In hvcs_open memset(..,0x00,..) instead of memset(..,0x3F,00).

 * Removed braces around single statements following conditionals.  Removed '=

 * 0' after static int declarations since these default to zero.  Removed

 * list_for_each_safe() and replaced with list_for_each_entry() in

 * hvcs_get_by_index().  The 'safe' version is un-needed now that the driver is

 * using spinlocks.  Changed spin_lock_irqsave() to spin_lock() when locking

 * hvcs_structs_lock and hvcs_pi_lock since these are not touched in an int

 * handler.  Initialized hvcs_structs_lock and hvcs_pi_lock to

 * SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED at declaration time rather than in hvcs_module_init().

 * Added spin_lock around list_del() in destroy_hvcs_struct() to protect the

 * list traversals from a deletion.  Removed '= NULL' from pointer declaration

 * statements since they are initialized NULL by default.  Removed wmb()

 * instances from hvcs_try_write().  They probably aren't needed with locking in

 * place.  Added check and cleanup for hvcs_pi_buff = kmalloc() in

 * hvcs_module_init().  Exposed hvcs_struct.index via a sysfs attribute so that

 * the coupling between /dev/hvcs* and a vty-server can be automatically

 * determined.  Moved kobject_put() in hvcs_open outside of the

 * spin_unlock_irqrestore().

 *

 * 1.3.1 -> 1.3.2 Changed method for determining hvcs_struct->index and had it

 * align with how the tty layer always assigns the lowest index available.  This

 * change resulted in a list of ints that denotes which indexes are available.

 * Device additions and removals use the new hvcs_get_index() and

 * hvcs_return_index() helper functions.  The list is created with

 * hvsc_alloc_index_list() and it is destroyed with hvcs_free_index_list().

 * Without these fixes hotplug vty-server adapter support goes crazy with this

 * driver if the user removes a vty-server adapter.  Moved free_irq() outside of

 * the hvcs_final_close() function in order to get it out of the spinlock.

 * Rearranged hvcs_close().  Cleaned up some printks and did some housekeeping

 * on the changelog.  Removed local CLC_LENGTH and used HVCS_CLC_LENGTH from

 * arch/powerepc/include/asm/hvcserver.h

 *

 * 1.3.2 -> 1.3.3 Replaced yield() in hvcs_close() with tty_wait_until_sent() to

 * prevent possible lockup with realtime scheduling as similarly pointed out by

 * akpm in hvc_console.  Changed resulted in the removal of hvcs_final_close()

 * to reorder cleanup operations and prevent discarding of pending data during

 * an hvcs_close().  Removed spinlock protection of hvcs_struct data members in

 * hvcs_write_room() and hvcs_chars_in_buffer() because they aren't needed.

/*

 * Wait this long per iteration while trying to push buffered data to the

 * hypervisor before allowing the tty to complete a close operation.

/*

 * Since the Linux TTY code does not currently (2-04-2004) support dynamic

 * addition of tty derived devices and we shouldn't allocate thousands of

 * tty_device pointers when the number of vty-server & vty partner connections

 * will most often be much lower than this, we'll arbitrarily allocate

 * HVCS_DEFAULT_SERVER_ADAPTERS tty_structs and cdev's by default when we

 * register the tty_driver. This can be overridden using an insmod parameter.

/*

 * The user can't insmod with more than HVCS_MAX_SERVER_ADAPTERS hvcs device

 * nodes as a sanity check.  Theoretically there can be over 1 Billion

 * vty-server & vty partner connections.

/*

 * We let Linux assign us a major number and we start the minors at zero.  There

 * is no intuitive mapping between minor number and the target vty-server

 * adapter except that each new vty-server adapter is always assigned to the

 * smallest minor number available.

/*

 * The hcall interface involves putting 8 chars into each of two registers.

 * We load up those 2 registers (in arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/hvconsole.c)

 * by casting char[16] to long[2].  It would work without __ALIGNED__, but a 

 * little (tiny) bit slower because an unaligned load is slower than aligned 

 * load.

/*

 * How much data can firmware send with each hvc_put_chars()?  Maybe this

 * should be moved into an architecture specific area.

/*

 * This is the maximum amount of data we'll let the user send us (hvcs_write) at

 * once in a chunk as a sanity check.

/*

 * Be careful when adding flags to this line discipline.  Don't add anything

 * that will cause echoing or we'll go into recursive loop echoing chars back

 * and forth with the console drivers.

/*

 * This value is used to take the place of a command line parameter when the

 * module is inserted.  It starts as -1 and stays as such if the user doesn't

 * specify a module insmod parameter.  If they DO specify one then it is set to

 * the value of the integer passed in.

 Status of partner info rescan triggered via sysfs. */

/*

 * In order to be somewhat sane this driver always associates the hvcs_struct

 * index element with the numerically equal tty->index.  This means that a

 * hotplugged vty-server adapter will always map to the lowest index valued

 * device node.  If vty-servers were hotplug removed from the system and then

 * new ones added the new vty-server may have the largest slot number of all

 * the vty-server adapters in the partition but it may have the lowest dev node

 * index of all the adapters due to the hole left by the hotplug removed

 * adapter.  There are a set of functions provided to get the lowest index for

 * a new device as well as return the index to the list.  This list is allocated

 * with a number of elements equal to the number of device nodes requested when

 * the module was inserted.

/*

 * How large is the list?  This is kept for traversal since the list is

 * dynamically created.

/*

 * Used by the khvcsd to pick up I/O operations when the kernel_thread is

 * already awake but potentially shifted to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state.

/*

 * Use by the kthread construct for task operations like waking the sleeping

 * thread and stopping the kthread.

/* Host Virtual Serial Interface (HVSI) is a protocol between the hosted OS

 * serial ports, so this over-complicated protocol allows the OS to control

	 * UART has 4 deep RX-FIFO. Driver's recongnition of this fact

	 * is very subtle. Here's how ...

	 * Upon getting a RX-Intr, such that RX-EMPTY=0, meaning data available,

	 * driver reads the DATA Reg and keeps doing that in a loop, until

	 * RX-EMPTY=1. Multiple chars being avail, with a single Interrupt,

	 * before RX-EMPTY=0, implies some sort of buffering going on in the

	 * controller, which is indeed the Rx-FIFO.

		/*

		 * This could be an Rx Intr for err (no data),

		 * so check err and clear that Intr first

/*

 * A note on the Interrupt handling state machine of this driver

 *

 * kernel printk writes funnel thru the console driver framework and in order

 * to keep things simple as well as efficient, it writes to UART in polled

 * mode, in one shot, and exits.

 *

 * OTOH, Userland output (via tty layer), uses interrupt based writes as there

 * can be undeterministic delay between char writes.

 *

 * Thus Rx-interrupts are always enabled, while tx-interrupts are by default

 * disabled.

 *

 * When tty has some data to send out, serial core calls driver's start_tx

 * which

 *   -checks-if-tty-buffer-has-char-to-send

 *   -writes-data-to-uart

 *   -enable-tx-intr

 *

 * Once data bits are pushed out, controller raises the Tx-room-avail-Interrupt.

 * The first thing Tx ISR does is disable further Tx interrupts (as this could

 * be the last char to send, before settling down into the quiet polled mode).

 * It then calls the exact routine used by tty layer write to send out any

 * more char in tty buffer. In case of sending, it re-enables Tx-intr. In case

 * of no data, it remains disabled.

 * This is how the transmit state machine is dynamically switched on/off

	/*

	 * Single IRQ for both Rx (data available) Tx (room available) Interrupt

	 * notifications from the UART Controller.

 * FixZeroBug....Works around a bug in the SCC receiving channel.

 * Inspired from Darwin code, 15 Sept. 2000  -DanM

 *

 * The following sequence prevents a problem that is seen with O'Hare ASICs

 * (most versions -- also with some Heathrow and Hydra ASICs) where a zero

 * at the input to the receiver becomes 'stuck' and locks up the receiver.

 * This problem can occur as a result of a zero bit at the receiver input

 * coincident with any of the following events:

 *

 *	The SCC is initialized (hardware or software).

 *	A framing error is detected.

 *	The clocking option changes from synchronous or X1 asynchronous

 *		clocking to X16, X32, or X64 asynchronous clocking.

 *	The decoding mode is changed among NRZ, NRZI, FM0, or FM1.

 *

 * This workaround attempts to recover from the lockup condition by placing

 * the SCC in synchronous loopback mode with a fast clock before programming

 * any of the asynchronous modes.

 Didn't we already do this? */

/*

 * SIIG serial cards have an PCI interface chip which also controls

 * the UART clocking frequency. Each UART can be clocked independently

 * (except cards equipped with 4 UARTs) and initial clocking settings

 * are stored in the EEPROM chip. It can cause problems because this

 * version of serial driver doesn't support differently clocked UART's

 * on single PCI card. To prevent this, initialization functions set

 * high frequency clocking for all UART's on given card. It is safe (I

 * hope) because it doesn't touch EEPROM settings to prevent conflicts

 * with other OSes (like M$ DOS).

 *

 *  SIIG support added by Andrey Panin <pazke@donpac.ru>, 10/1999

 *

 * There is two family of SIIG serial cards with different PCI

 * interface chip and different configuration methods:

 *     - 10x cards have control registers in IO and/or memory space;

 *     - 20x cards have control registers in standard PCI configuration space.

 *

 * Note: all 10x cards have PCI device ids 0x10..

 *       all 20x cards have PCI device ids 0x20..

 *

 * There are also Quartet Serial cards which use Oxford Semiconductor

 * 16954 quad UART PCI chip clocked by 18.432 MHz quartz.

 *

 * Note: some SIIG cards are probed by the parport_serial object.

	 * base frequency of 7.3728MHz, always used.  If set to 0, then

	 * the base frequency is divided by 4 for use by the Baud Rate

	 * Generator, for the usual arrangement where the value of 1 of

	 * the divisor produces the baud rate of 115200bps.  Conversely,

	 * if set to 1 and high-speed operation has been enabled with the

	 * Serial Port Mode Register in the Device Configuration Space,

	 * then the base frequency is supplied directly to the Baud Rate

	 * Generator, so for the divisor values of 0x8001, 0x8002, 0x8003,

	 * 0x8004, etc. the respective baud rates produced are 460800bps,

	 * 230400bps, 153600bps, 115200bps, etc.

	 * In all cases only low 15 bits of the divisor are used to divide

	 * the baud base and therefore 32767 is the maximum divisor value

	 * possible, even though documentation says that the programmable

 * TI TRF7970a RFID/NFC Transceiver Driver

 *

 * Copyright (C) 2013 Texas Instruments Incorporated - http://www.ti.com

 *

 * Author: Erick Macias <emacias@ti.com>

 * Author: Felipe Balbi <balbi@ti.com>

 * Author: Mark A. Greer <mgreer@animalcreek.com>

/* There are 3 ways the host can communicate with the trf7970a:

 * parallel mode, SPI with Slave Select (SS) mode, and SPI without

 * SS mode.  The driver only supports the two SPI modes.

 *

 * The trf7970a is very timing sensitive and the VIN, EN2, and EN

 * pins must asserted in that order and with specific delays in between.

 * The delays used in the driver were provided by TI and have been

 * confirmed to work with this driver.  There is a bug with the current

 * version of the trf7970a that requires that EN2 remain low no matter

 * what.  If it goes high, it will generate an RF field even when in

 * passive target mode.  TI has indicated that the chip will work okay

 * when EN2 is left low.  The 'en2-rf-quirk' device tree property

 * indicates that trf7970a currently being used has the erratum and

 * that EN2 must be kept low.

 *

 * Timeouts are implemented using the delayed workqueue kernel facility.

 * Timeouts are required so things don't hang when there is no response

 * from the trf7970a (or tag).  Using this mechanism creates a race with

 * interrupts, however.  That is, an interrupt and a timeout could occur

 * closely enough together that one is blocked by the mutex while the other

 * executes.  When the timeout handler executes first and blocks the

 * interrupt handler, it will eventually set the state to IDLE so the

 * interrupt handler will check the state and exit with no harm done.

 * When the interrupt handler executes first and blocks the timeout handler,

 * the cancel_delayed_work() call will know that it didn't cancel the

 * work item (i.e., timeout) and will return zero.  That return code is

 * used by the timer handler to indicate that it should ignore the timeout

 * once its unblocked.

 *

 * Aborting an active command isn't as simple as it seems because the only

 * way to abort a command that's already been sent to the tag is so turn

 * off power to the tag.  If we do that, though, we'd have to go through

 * the entire anticollision procedure again but the digital layer doesn't

 * support that.  So, if an abort is received before trf7970a_send_cmd()

 * has sent the command to the tag, it simply returns -ECANCELED.  If the

 * command has already been sent to the tag, then the driver continues

 * normally and recieves the response data (or error) but just before

 * sending the data upstream, it frees the rx_skb and sends -ECANCELED

 * upstream instead.  If the command failed, that error will be sent

 * upstream.

 *

 * When recieving data from a tag and the interrupt status register has

 * only the SRX bit set, it means that all of the data has been received

 * (once what's in the fifo has been read).  However, depending on timing

 * an interrupt status with only the SRX bit set may not be recived.  In

 * those cases, the timeout mechanism is used to wait 20 ms in case more

 * data arrives.  After 20 ms, it is assumed that all of the data has been

 * received and the accumulated rx data is sent upstream.  The

 * 'TRF7970A_ST_WAIT_FOR_RX_DATA_CONT' state is used for this purpose

 * (i.e., it indicates that some data has been received but we're not sure

 * if there is more coming so a timeout in this state means all data has

 * been received and there isn't an error).  The delay is 20 ms since delays

 * of ~16 ms have been observed during testing.

 *

 * When transmitting a frame larger than the FIFO size (127 bytes), the

 * driver will wait 20 ms for the FIFO to drain past the low-watermark

 * and generate an interrupt.  The low-watermark set to 32 bytes so the

 * interrupt should fire after 127 - 32 = 95 bytes have been sent.  At

 * the lowest possible bit rate (6.62 kbps for 15693), it will take up

 * to ~14.35 ms so 20 ms is used for the timeout.

 *

 * Type 2 write and sector select commands respond with a 4-bit ACK or NACK.

 * Having only 4 bits in the FIFO won't normally generate an interrupt so

 * driver enables the '4_bit_RX' bit of the Special Functions register 1

 * to cause an interrupt in that case.  Leaving that bit for a read command

 * messes up the data returned so it is only enabled when the framing is

 * 'NFC_DIGITAL_FRAMING_NFCA_T2T' and the command is not a read command.

 * Unfortunately, that means that the driver has to peek into tx frames

 * when the framing is 'NFC_DIGITAL_FRAMING_NFCA_T2T'.  This is done by

 * the trf7970a_per_cmd_config() routine.

 *

 * ISO/IEC 15693 frames specify whether to use single or double sub-carrier

 * frequencies and whether to use low or high data rates in the flags byte

 * of the frame.  This means that the driver has to peek at all 15693 frames

 * to determine what speed to set the communication to.  In addition, write

 * and lock commands use the OPTION flag to indicate that an EOF must be

 * sent to the tag before it will send its response.  So the driver has to

 * examine all frames for that reason too.

 *

 * It is unclear how long to wait before sending the EOF.  According to the

 * Note under Table 1-1 in section 1.6 of

 * http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/scbu011/scbu011.pdf, that wait should be at least

 * 10 ms for TI Tag-it HF-I tags; however testing has shown that is not long

 * enough so 20 ms is used.  So the timer is set to 40 ms - 20 ms to drain

 * up to 127 bytes in the FIFO at the lowest bit rate plus another 20 ms to

 * ensure the wait is long enough before sending the EOF.  This seems to work

 * reliably.

 * The function sends a priority cmd directly to the chip omitting the cmd

 * queue. It's intended to be used by chaining mechanism of received responses

 * where the host has to request every single chunk of data before scheduling

 * next cmd from the queue.

/*  pn533_send_cmd_sync

 *

 *  Please note the req parameter is freed inside the function to

 *  limit a number of return value interpretations by the caller.

 *

 *  1. negative in case of error during TX path -> req should be freed

 *

 *  2. negative in case of error during RX path -> req should not be freed

 *     as it's been already freed at the beginning of RX path by

 *     async_complete_cb.

 *  3. valid pointer in case of successful RX path

 *

 *  A caller has to check a return value with IS_ERR macro. If the test pass,

   Uniform CD-ROM driver for Linux.

   See Documentation/cdrom/cdrom-standard.rst for usage information.



   The routines in the file provide a uniform interface between the

   software that uses CD-ROMs and the various low-level drivers that

   actually talk to the hardware. Suggestions are welcome.

   Patches that work are more welcome though.  ;-)



 To Do List:

 ----------------------------------



 -- Modify sysctl/proc interface. I plan on having one directory per

 drive, with entries for outputing general drive information, and sysctl

 based tunable parameters such as whether the tray should auto-close for

 that drive. Suggestions (or patches) for this welcome!





 Revision History

 ----------------------------------

 1.00  Date Unknown -- David van Leeuwen <david@tm.tno.nl>

 -- Initial version by David A. van Leeuwen. I don't have a detailed

  changelog for the 1.x series, David?



2.00  Dec  2, 1997 -- Erik Andersen <andersee@debian.org>

  -- New maintainer! As David A. van Leeuwen has been too busy to actively

  maintain and improve this driver, I am now carrying on the torch. If

  you have a problem with this driver, please feel free to contact me.



  -- Added (rudimentary) sysctl interface. I realize this is really weak

  right now, and is _very_ badly implemented. It will be improved...



  -- Modified CDROM_DISC_STATUS so that it is now incorporated into

  the Uniform CD-ROM driver via the cdrom_count_tracks function.

  The cdrom_count_tracks function helps resolve some of the false

  assumptions of the CDROM_DISC_STATUS ioctl, and is also used to check

  for the correct media type when mounting or playing audio from a CD.



  -- Remove the calls to verify_area and only use the copy_from_user and

  copy_to_user stuff, since these calls now provide their own memory

  checking with the 2.1.x kernels.



  -- Major update to return codes so that errors from low-level drivers

  are passed on through (thanks to Gerd Knorr for pointing out this

  problem).



  -- Made it so if a function isn't implemented in a low-level driver,

  ENOSYS is now returned instead of EINVAL.



  -- Simplified some complex logic so that the source code is easier to read.



  -- Other stuff I probably forgot to mention (lots of changes).



2.01 to 2.11 Dec 1997-Jan 1998

  -- TO-DO!  Write changelogs for 2.01 to 2.12.



2.12  Jan  24, 1998 -- Erik Andersen <andersee@debian.org>

  -- Fixed a bug in the IOCTL_IN and IOCTL_OUT macros.  It turns out that

  copy_*_user does not return EFAULT on error, but instead returns the number 

  of bytes not copied.  I was returning whatever non-zero stuff came back from 

  the copy_*_user functions directly, which would result in strange errors.



2.13  July 17, 1998 -- Erik Andersen <andersee@debian.org>

  -- Fixed a bug in CDROM_SELECT_SPEED where you couldn't lower the speed

  of the drive.  Thanks to Tobias Ringstr|m <tori@prosolvia.se> for pointing

  this out and providing a simple fix.

  -- Fixed the procfs-unload-module bug with the fill_inode procfs callback.

  thanks to Andrea Arcangeli

  -- Fixed it so that the /proc entry now also shows up when cdrom is

  compiled into the kernel.  Before it only worked when loaded as a module.



  2.14 August 17, 1998 -- Erik Andersen <andersee@debian.org>

  -- Fixed a bug in cdrom_media_changed and handling of reporting that

  the media had changed for devices that _don't_ implement media_changed.  

  Thanks to Grant R. Guenther <grant@torque.net> for spotting this bug.

  -- Made a few things more pedanticly correct.



2.50 Oct 19, 1998 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- New maintainers! Erik was too busy to continue the work on the driver,

  so now Chris Zwilling <chris@cloudnet.com> and Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  will do their best to follow in his footsteps

  

  2.51 Dec 20, 1998 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- Check if drive is capable of doing what we ask before blindly changing

  cdi->options in various ioctl.

  -- Added version to proc entry.

  

  2.52 Jan 16, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- Fixed an error in open_for_data where we would sometimes not return

  the correct error value. Thanks Huba Gaspar <huba@softcell.hu>.

  -- Fixed module usage count - usage was based on /proc/sys/dev

  instead of /proc/sys/dev/cdrom. This could lead to an oops when other

  modules had entries in dev. Feb 02 - real bug was in sysctl.c where

  dev would be removed even though it was used. cdrom.c just illuminated

  that bug.

  

  2.53 Feb 22, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- Fixup of several ioctl calls, in particular CDROM_SET_OPTIONS has

  been "rewritten" because capabilities and options aren't in sync. They

  should be...

  -- Added CDROM_LOCKDOOR ioctl. Locks the door and keeps it that way.

  -- Added CDROM_RESET ioctl.

  -- Added CDROM_DEBUG ioctl. Enable debug messages on-the-fly.

  -- Added CDROM_GET_CAPABILITY ioctl. This relieves userspace programs

  from parsing /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info.

  

  2.54 Mar 15, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- Check capability mask from low level driver when counting tracks as

  per suggestion from Corey J. Scotts <cstotts@blue.weeg.uiowa.edu>.

  

  2.55 Apr 25, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- autoclose was mistakenly checked against CDC_OPEN_TRAY instead of

  CDC_CLOSE_TRAY.

  -- proc info didn't mask against capabilities mask.

  

  3.00 Aug 5, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- Unified audio ioctl handling across CD-ROM drivers. A lot of the

  code was duplicated before. Drives that support the generic packet

  interface are now being fed packets from here instead.

  -- First attempt at adding support for MMC2 commands - for DVD and

  CD-R(W) drives. Only the DVD parts are in now - the interface used is

  the same as for the audio ioctls.

  -- ioctl cleanups. if a drive couldn't play audio, it didn't get

  a change to perform device specific ioctls as well.

  -- Defined CDROM_CAN(CDC_XXX) for checking the capabilities.

  -- Put in sysctl files for autoclose, autoeject, check_media, debug,

  and lock.

  -- /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info has been updated to also contain info about

  CD-Rx and DVD capabilities.

  -- Now default to checking media type.

  -- CDROM_SEND_PACKET ioctl added. The infrastructure was in place for

  doing this anyway, with the generic_packet addition.

  

  3.01 Aug 6, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- Fix up the sysctl handling so that the option flags get set

  correctly.

  -- Fix up ioctl handling so the device specific ones actually get

  called :).

  

  3.02 Aug 8, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- Fixed volume control on SCSI drives (or others with longer audio

  page).

  -- Fixed a couple of DVD minors. Thanks to Andrew T. Veliath

  <andrewtv@usa.net> for telling me and for having defined the various

  DVD structures and ioctls in the first place! He designed the original

  DVD patches for ide-cd and while I rearranged and unified them, the

  interface is still the same.

  

  3.03 Sep 1, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- Moved the rest of the audio ioctls from the CD-ROM drivers here. Only

  CDROMREADTOCENTRY and CDROMREADTOCHDR are left.

  -- Moved the CDROMREADxxx ioctls in here.

  -- Defined the cdrom_get_last_written and cdrom_get_next_block as ioctls

  and exported functions.

  -- Erik Andersen <andersen@xmission.com> modified all SCMD_ commands

  to now read GPCMD_ for the new generic packet interface. All low level

  drivers are updated as well.

  -- Various other cleanups.



  3.04 Sep 12, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- Fixed a couple of possible memory leaks (if an operation failed and

  we didn't free the buffer before returning the error).

  -- Integrated Uniform CD Changer handling from Richard Sharman

  <rsharman@pobox.com>.

  -- Defined CD_DVD and CD_CHANGER log levels.

  -- Fixed the CDROMREADxxx ioctls.

  -- CDROMPLAYTRKIND uses the GPCMD_PLAY_AUDIO_MSF command - too few

  drives supported it. We lose the index part, however.

  -- Small modifications to accommodate opens of /dev/hdc1, required

  for ide-cd to handle multisession discs.

  -- Export cdrom_mode_sense and cdrom_mode_select.

  -- init_cdrom_command() for setting up a cgc command.

  

  3.05 Oct 24, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- Changed the interface for CDROM_SEND_PACKET. Before it was virtually

  impossible to send the drive data in a sensible way.

  -- Lowered stack usage in mmc_ioctl(), dvd_read_disckey(), and

  dvd_read_manufact.

  -- Added setup of write mode for packet writing.

  -- Fixed CDDA ripping with cdda2wav - accept much larger requests of

  number of frames and split the reads in blocks of 8.



  3.06 Dec 13, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>

  -- Added support for changing the region of DVD drives.

  -- Added sense data to generic command.



  3.07 Feb 2, 2000 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>

  -- Do same "read header length" trick in cdrom_get_disc_info() as

  we do in cdrom_get_track_info() -- some drive don't obey specs and

  fail if they can't supply the full Mt Fuji size table.

  -- Deleted stuff related to setting up write modes. It has a different

  home now.

  -- Clear header length in mode_select unconditionally.

  -- Removed the register_disk() that was added, not needed here.



  3.08 May 1, 2000 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>

  -- Fix direction flag in setup_send_key and setup_report_key. This

  gave some SCSI adapters problems.

  -- Always return -EROFS for write opens

  -- Convert to module_init/module_exit style init and remove some

  of the #ifdef MODULE stuff

  -- Fix several dvd errors - DVD_LU_SEND_ASF should pass agid,

  DVD_HOST_SEND_RPC_STATE did not set buffer size in cdb, and

  dvd_do_auth passed uninitialized data to drive because init_cdrom_command

  did not clear a 0 sized buffer.

  

  3.09 May 12, 2000 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>

  -- Fix Video-CD on SCSI drives that don't support READ_CD command. In

  that case switch block size and issue plain READ_10 again, then switch

  back.



  3.10 Jun 10, 2000 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>

  -- Fix volume control on CD's - old SCSI-II drives now use their own

  code, as doing MODE6 stuff in here is really not my intention.

  -- Use READ_DISC_INFO for more reliable end-of-disc.



  3.11 Jun 12, 2000 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>

  -- Fix bug in getting rpc phase 2 region info.

  -- Reinstate "correct" CDROMPLAYTRKIND



   3.12 Oct 18, 2000 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>

  -- Use quiet bit on packet commands not known to work



   3.20 Dec 17, 2003 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>

  -- Various fixes and lots of cleanups not listed :-)

  -- Locking fixes

  -- Mt Rainier support

  -- DVD-RAM write open fixes

	 * Workaround for errata i743 - LPDDR2 Power-Down State is Not

	 * Efficient

	 *

	 * i743 DESCRIPTION:

	 * The EMIF supports power-down state for low power. The EMIF

	 * automatically puts the SDRAM into power-down after the memory is

	 * not accessed for a defined number of cycles and the

	 * EMIF_PWR_MGMT_CTRL[10:8] REG_LP_MODE bit field is set to 0x4.

	 * As the EMIF supports automatic output impedance calibration, a ZQ

	 * calibration long command is issued every time it exits active

	 * power-down and precharge power-down modes. The EMIF waits and

	 * blocks any other command during this calibration.

	 * The EMIF does not allow selective disabling of ZQ calibration upon

	 * exit of power-down mode. Due to very short periods of power-down

	 * cycles, ZQ calibration overhead creates bandwidth issues and

	 * increases overall system power consumption. On the other hand,

	 * issuing ZQ calibration long commands when exiting self-refresh is

	 * still required.

	 *

	 * WORKAROUND

	 * Because there is no power consumption benefit of the power-down due

	 * to the calibration and there is a performance risk, the guideline

	 * is to not allow power-down state and, therefore, to not have set

	 * the EMIF_PWR_MGMT_CTRL[10:8] REG_LP_MODE bit field to 0x4.

	/*

	 * Workaround for errata i728: Disable LPMODE during FREQ_UPDATE

	 *

	 * i728 DESCRIPTION:

	 * The EMIF automatically puts the SDRAM into self-refresh mode

	 * after the EMIF has not performed accesses during

	 * EMIF_PWR_MGMT_CTRL[7:4] REG_SR_TIM number of DDR clock cycles

	 * and the EMIF_PWR_MGMT_CTRL[10:8] REG_LP_MODE bit field is set

	 * to 0x2. If during a small window the following three events

	 * occur:

	 * - The SR_TIMING counter expires

	 * - And frequency change is requested

	 * - And OCP access is requested

	 * Then it causes instable clock on the DDR interface.

	 *

	 * WORKAROUND

	 * To avoid the occurrence of the three events, the workaround

	 * is to disable the self-refresh when requesting a frequency

	 * change. Before requesting a frequency change the software must

	 * program EMIF_PWR_MGMT_CTRL[10:8] REG_LP_MODE to 0x0. When the

	 * frequency change has been done, the software can reprogram

	 * EMIF_PWR_MGMT_CTRL[10:8] REG_LP_MODE to 0x2

 * alternative clock source set as parent is stable.

 * The second parent's clock frequency is fixed to 400MHz, it is named 'bypass'

 * clock. This requires alignment in DRAM timing parameters for the new

 * T-period. There is two bank sets for keeping DRAM

 * timings: set 0 and set 1. The set 0 is used when main clock source is

 * chosen. The 2nd set of regs is used for 'bypass' clock. Switching between

 * the two bank sets is part of the process.

 * The voltage must also be aligned to the minimum required level. There is

 * this intermediate step with switching to 'bypass' parent clock source.

 * if the old voltage is lower, it requires an increase of the voltage level.

 * The complexity of the voltage manipulation is hidden in low level function.

 * In this function there is last alignment of the voltage level at the end.
